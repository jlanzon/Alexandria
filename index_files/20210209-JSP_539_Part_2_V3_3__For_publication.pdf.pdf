Part 2: Guidance
2-i JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21 Foreword
Part 2 of this JSP provides guidance in accordance with the policy set out in Part 1 of this 
JSP; the guidance is sponsored by the Defence Authority for Healthcare and Medical.  It 
provides policy -compliant b usiness practices which should be considered best practice in 
the absence of any contradicting instruction. However, nothing in this document should 
discourage the application of common sense.
It is also important note that this extant version of the JSP covers only the Medical 
management of c oldinjury . 
The Defence Authority for Health ,Safety and Environmental Protection sponsors the 
Prevention elements associated with Heat Illness and Cold Injury (in JSP 375 Volume 1 
Chapter 41 and 42 respectively).
The Medical Treatment of Heat Illness is now in JSP 950 leaflets 2 -4-4(Acute Medical 
Treatment of Heat Illness) and 2 -22-4 (Heat Illness Rehabilitation and Specialist 
Investigations).

How to use this JSP
1. This JSP is the Joint Service code of practice for the medical ma nagement of cold 
injury . JSP 375 Chapters 41 & 42 cover prevent ionof heat illness and cold injury 
respectively whilst t he medical treatment of heat illness is in JSP 950 leaflets 2 -4-4 (Acute 
Medical Treatment of Heat Illness) and 2 -22-4 (Heat Illness Rehabilitation and Specialist 
Investigations .The JSP swill be supported, where necessary by single Service instructions
and other guidance .  They cannot cover every possible eventuality; however, they support
the principles which should be applied at all times in order to minimise the risks and 
mitigate the effects of heat illness and cold injury.  Commanders ,and those advising 
Command, should note that it is entirely possible to be at risk from both heat illness and 
cold injury within the same theatre of operations.
2. The JSP contains only guidance on the initial medical management and treatment of 
coldcasualties . Clinical Guidelines for Operations should also be consulted especially for 
management inSecondary Health Care .
3. The JSP is structured in two parts:
a. Part 1 -Directive, which provides the direction that must be followed in 
accordance with statute or policy mandated by Defence or on Defence by Central 
Government.
b. Part 2 -Guidance, which provides the guidance and best practice that will assist 
the user to comply with the Directive(s) detailed in Part 1.
Training
4.All personnel .  All personnel are to be made aware of:
a. Heat illness.
b. Cold Injury.

Responsibilities
1.All medical personnel should be trained in the prevention and management of cold 
injury (appropriate to their level of competency and responsibility).  This should be part of 
initial military medical training for all medical personnel in the DMS , with appropriate 
refresher training p eriodically thereafter, targeted by clinical speciality. Civilian DMS 
personnel should be trained to a level appropriate to their role.
2.In the event of a single case of cold injury, a lways consider the other members of the 
group or party.  If one indi vidual has been affected by the cold, then there is a high 
likelihood that others may also be affected.  The C hain of Command should be alerted 
that other personnel may be at risk.
3.This section provide smedical personnel with an accessible source of information to 
assist them in the pre -hospital care and management of cold injuries .  Cold injur ies
considered here are Hypothermia , Freezing Cold Injury (FCI) and Non-Freezing Cold 
Injury (NFCI) .
Prevention
4. Prevention. The adage that “prevention is better than treatment” is especially true for 
cold injuries, which may be preventable. Risk of cold injury can also be related to underlying 
medical problems, and prevention should address both environmental and health -related 
aspects. One should both ensure adequate perfusion and minimise heat loss to prevent FCI.
5. Maintaining peripheral perfusion. Preventive measures to ensure local tissue 
perfusion include: 
a. Maintaining adequate core temperature and body hydration.
b. Minimising effects of known diseases or medications and drugs that may decrease 
perfusion. 
c. Covering all skin and the scalp to avoid vasoconstriction where practicable .
d. Minimising restriction in blood ﬂow, such as constrictive clothing, footwear, or 
immobility. 
e. Ensuring adequate nutrition.
f. Using supplemental oxygen in hypoxic con ditions ( e.g.>4000m). 
6. Protection from cold .Measures should be taken to minimise exposure to cold.  These 
measures include the following: 
a. Avoiding environmental conditions with a risk of cold injury , speciﬁcally below –5°C 
even with low wind speeds.
b. Protecting skin from moisture, wind, and cold.4-2 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21c. Avoiding perspiration or wet extremities.
d. Increasing insulation and skin protection by layering clothes appropriately.
e. Ensuring personnel are able to take the appropriate behavio ural response to 
changing environmental conditions ( e.g., not being under the in ﬂuence of drugs or 
alcohol or suffering extreme hypoxemia).
f. Using chemical hand and foot warmers and electric foot warmers to maintain 
peripheral warmth (note: warmers should be close to body temperature before being 
activated and should not be placed directly against the skin nor constrict ﬂow if used 
within a boot).
g. Performing “cold checks” if an individual experiences extremity numbness or pain 
or is concerned that FCImay be developing.
h. Recognising frostnip or super ﬁcial frostbite before it becomes more serious.
i. Minimising duration of cold exposure. 
The time that a digit or extremity can remain numb before developing FCIis unknown; thus, 
paresthesia should be addressed as soon as possible. An extremity at risk for frostbite ( e.g., 
numb, poor dexterity, pale colo ur) should be warmed with adjacent body heat from the 
person or a companion, in the axilla, or on the abdomen. 
Individual risk factors
7. There is a wide variation in human tolerance to cold.  In some cases of Cold Injury it is 
possible to identify factors that have caused particular individ uals to become casualties.  All 
ranks of medical personnel should be empowered to raise concerns if individuals taking part 
in the proposed activity have risk factors that commanders may not be aware of , 
notwithstanding appropriate professional codes of pa tient confidentiality .  Table 1 -Individual 
Risk Factors details the currently recognised individual risk factors:

Hypothermia1
8.During cold exposure, the initial res ponse of the body is to maintain a normal core 
temperature (approximately 37°C) by means of active movement and involuntary shivering. 
Primary hypothermia occurs when heat production in an otherwise healthy person is 
overcome by the stress of excessive col d, especially when the energy stores of the body are 
deplete d. In hypothermia, conscious level , breathing, and circulation are initially intact but 
become more impaired as the body cools.
9. Patients should be considered to have hypothermia if they have a core temperature of 
less than 35°C.  Hypothermia can also be staged clinically using the Swiss classification 
system (stages HT I to HT IV) as detailed in Table 2 -Staging and Management of Accidental 
Hypothermia .  The Swiss staging system is a valuable clinical tool to facilitate triage and 
emergency treatment. However, definitive assessment of the severity of hypothermia 
requires accurate core temperature measurement using a low reading the rmometer.
Table 5-Staging and Management of Accidental Hypothermia
Stage Clinical 
symptoms *Typical core 
temperature†Treatment
HT IConscious, 
shivering35 -32°C Warm environment and clothing, warm sweet drinks, and active 
movement (if possible).
HT IIImpaired 
consciousness, 
not shivering<32 to 28°C Cardiac monitoring, minimal and cautious movements to avoid 
arrhythmias, horizontal position and immobilization, full body insulation, 
active external and minimally invasive rewarming techniques (warm 
environment; chemical heat packs).
HT IIIUnconscious, not 
shivering, 
vital signs present<28 to 24°C HT II management plus airway management as required; ECMO or CPB 
in cases with cardiac instability that is refractory to medical management.
HT IVNo vital signs <24°C HT II and III management plus CPR and up to three doses of epinephrine 
(at an intravenous or intraosseous dose of 1 mg) and defibrillation, with 
further dosing guided by clinical response; rewarming with ECMO or CPB 
(if available) or CPR with active external and alternative internal 
rewarming.Notes
*Hypothermia may be determined clinically on the basis of vital signs with the use of the Swiss staging system.  
CPB denotes cardiopulmonary bypass, CPR cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and ECMO extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation.
†Measurement of body core temperature is helpful but not mandatory. The risk of cardiac arrest increases as the 
core temperature drops below 32°C and increases substantially if the temperature is less than 28°C
1Cross -referenced with: Peter Paal et al (2016) Accidental hypothermia –an update Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Re suscitation and 
Emergency Medicine 2016 24:111.  https://sjtrem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13049 -016-0303 -7(accessed Nov 20 ).4-4 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 2110. Measurement of core temperature. If possible, measure core temperature using a 
low reading rectal thermometer. The recorded temperature can vary depending on the body 
site used and environmental temperature. A measured core temperature of 32 -35 °C 
signifies mild hypothermia with severe hypothermia occurring with a core temperature below 
32°.When accurate measure ment of the core temperature is not feasible ,as in some field 
settings, decisions regarding management should be based solely on the clinical Swiss 
staging system2.
a. Thermistor probe .  A thermistor probe in contact with the tympanic membrane 
accuratel y reflects brain temperature, provided that the ear canal is free of snow and 
wax and is well insulated against the environment. 
b. Infrared cutaneous, aural and oral thermometers. Measurements obtained 
with the us e of infrared cutaneous, aural and oral thermometers are often inaccurate in 
patients with hypothermia. 
c. Rectal probes. Rectal probes should be inserted to a depth of 15 cm for optimum 
accuracy, but readings may lag behind core temperature during rewarming. 
11. Pre-hospital treat ment p riorities. Treatment is summarised in Annex A -First 
Responder Initial Treatment of Hypothermia Und er Field Conditions and Annex B -Treatment 
of Hypothermia byEmergency Doctors and Professional Rescuers .  Pre-hospital treatments 
include careful handling of the patient (to reduce risk of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias), 
provision of basic or advanced life support, passive and active external rewarming and 
transport to an appropriate facility.  
a. Some p atients with a core temperature <28°C engage in paradoxical undressing. 
b. Detecting a pulse in a patient with hypothermia may be difficult so signs of life and 
pulse should be checked carefully for 60 seconds.  
c. Persistent breathing or movement by the patient should prompt a strategy of 
watchful waiting but if no signs of life are detected cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
should be started.  
d. Advanced airway management should be performed if indicated to op timise 
ventilation, oxygenation and cerebral perfusion.  
e. Atrial fibrillation is common when the core temperature is less than 32°C.  
Rewarming will often lead to spontaneous cardioversion to sinus rhythm.
f. The risk of cardiac arrest increases as th e core temperature drops below 32°C and 
increases substantially if the temperature is less than 28°C.
g. Owing to the decrease in cerebral oxygen requirements with cooling, survival 
without neurologic impairment may be possible even when it is necessary to perform 
CPR for several hours.
12. Rewarming. Full-body insulation and rewarming should be provided for all patients as 
long as it does not impede CPR or delay transport. For rewarming in the pre -hospital setting 
2Current scaled thermometers: Oral & rectal (32 -420C) NSN 6515 -99-898-2896; Tympanic (ear) (20 -400C) NSN 6515 -99-874-63304-5 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21well placed (junctional area s of the body not in direct contact with skin) chemical heat packs 
in association with ‘foil’ (Blizzard©) blankets should provide adequate heat transfer. Wet 
clothes should be removed if practical to do so (if not, ensure the patient is packaged using 
an impermeable layer (Blizzard©, bubble wrap or similar).
13.Resuscitation fluids. If intravenous fluids are indicated, they should be warmed (38 to 
42°C )to prevent further heat loss. It is worth noting that warm fluids have a small warming 
effect, but col d fluids have a significant cooling effect.
14. Transportation.
a. Stage HT I.Conscious, shivering patients can be treated in the field if they are 
uninjured or transported to a warm environment if rewarming is not possible in the field. 
b. Stage HT II, HT III, or HT IV. Patie nts with impaired consciousness should be 
assessed for cardiac instability.
(1) Patients with stable circulation require active external rewarming (placement 
in a warm environment; application of chemical heat packs and ‘foil’ (Blizzard©)) 
and should be taken to the nearest medical facility. 
(2) Patients with pre -hospital cardiac instability ( e.g.systolic blood pressure of 
<90 mm Hg or ventricular arrhythmias), those with a core temperature of less than 
28°C, and those in cardiac arrest sh ould be transported to a medical facility ideally 
capable of providing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) , unless coexisting conditions ( e.g.trauma) 
mandate transport to a closer facility.  
Other considerations
15.Serum potassium. A severely elevated serum potassium level is associated with non -
survival and is considered a marker of hypoxia before cooling.  Termination of CPR is 
recommended when the potassium level is >12mmol/l. When the pota ssium level is <12
mmol/l , survival without neurologic impairment may be possible, and CPR should be 
continued until the patient is rewarmed. Unfortunately, a low serum potassium level does not 
ensure survival.  Other bio markers, such as lactate and pH l evels, have been reported to 
have prognostic significance, although less consistently.
16.Field or en -route serum potassium testing. If the serum potassium can be measured 
in the field or en -route and the level is >12mmol per litre, termination of CPR should be 
considered.  If the patient is in cardiac arrest the use of a mechanical chest compression 
device should be used if availab le during the transportation phase.
Accidental hypothermia -special situations
17. Trauma. Shock caused by hypovolaemia and cerebrospinal injury destabilizes 
thermoregulation .Hypothermia increases bleeding as clotting factor activity and platelet 
function are reduced (a critical coagulopathy may occur with a body temp below 34°C ).
18. Avalanche burial without vital signs.4-6 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21a. Burial time <35 minutes, life threatening hypothermia is unlikely, owing to 
insufficient cooling time, and trauma .  Hypoxia s hould be suspected as the cause . 
b. Burial >35 minutes, the airway is packed with snow and the patient is asystolic, 
hypoxia preceded hypoth ermia and CPR is very unlikely to be beneficial. 
c. Burial >35 minutes andthe airway is not blocked, severe hypothermia should be 
suspected, and the patient should be treated accordingly. 
19. Drowning without vital signs. Persons who have been exposed to cold water may 
have a better outcome than those exposed to warm water. 
a. Immersion. If the patient’s history indicates immersion in cold water ( i.e.the body 
was exposed to cold water but the patient was able to breat he) and it is likely that the 
body cooled before the onset of hypoxia and cardiac arrest (stage HT IV), survival 
without neurologic impairment may be possible, and resuscitation should proceed ( e.g.
patient wearing a flotation device).
b. Submersion. If the history indicates submersion (head under) in cold water ( i.e.
the body was exposed to cold water and the patient was unable to breathe) before 
cooling, the outcome may be worse.
Frostnip
20. Frostnip is freezing of the superficial ski n usually affecting the cheeks, ears or nose. 
Ice crystals, appearing as frost, form on the surface of the skin. Ice crystals do not form in 
the tissue nor does tissue loss occur in frostnip. The numbness and pallor that occur 
resolve quickly after coveri ng the skin with appropriate clothing, warming the skin or 
gaining shelter that protects from the elements. No long -term damage occurs. The 
appearance of frostnip may be a precursor for frostbite and appropriate action should be 
undertaken immediately to prevent further injury. 
21. For military purposes frostnip is defined as a freezing cold injury which resolves 
completely within 30 minutes of commencing re -warming of the injured part. Residual 
symptoms after 30 minutes or more of re -warming confirm a diagnosis of superficial frostbite 
rather than frostnip.  Recurrent frostnip occurring in the same body location should result in 
review by a medical practitioner .
22. An individual diagnosed with frostnip (providing it is the first episode in that body area
that seaso n) may be retained in the field at the discretion of medical personnel and the 
local commander. Staff should be aware of the cumulative disability which c an result from 
recurrent minor cold injuries .
23.Unit medical personnel should ensure that they review anyone who has suffered 
frostnip when they return from field conditions, deployment or exercise, and that the injury 
is correctly recorded in the patient’s medical record (see Section 5).  Where there is any 
doubt as to their continuing fitness to operate in cold environments, they sho uld be 
referred to their Regional Occupational Health Team (ROHT) or the INM Cold Injury Clinic 
(CIC). Referrals to CI Cshould be via DMICP.  If it is unclear whether a patient should be 
referred, please discuss with the INM Environmental Medicine and Sciences Civilian 
Medic al Officer on Mil 9380 Ext 68050 Civ 02392 768050 .
Frostbite4-7 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 2124. Pathophysiology of frostbite. Frostbite may be divided into 4 phases: 
a. Pre-freeze .The pre -freeze phase consists of tissue cooling with accompanying 
vasoconstriction and isch aemia but does not involve actual ice crystal formation.  
Neuronal cooling and isch aemia cause hyper aesthesia or par aesthesia.
b. Freeze -thaw. In the freeze -thaw phase, ice crystals form intracellularly causing 
protein and lipid derangement, cellular electrolyte shifts, cellular dehydration, cell 
membrane lysis, and cell death.  The thawing process may initiate isch aemia -
reperfusion injury and the inﬂammatory response.
c. Vascular stasis .In the vascular stasis phase, vessels may ﬂuctuate between 
constriction and dila tation; blood may leak from vessels or coagulate within them.
d. Late isch aemic. The late isch aemic phase results from progres sive tissue 
ischaemia and infarction leading to cell death.
The initial cellular damage caused by ice crystals and the subsequent post -thawing 
processes are made worse if refreezing follows thawing of injured tissues.
25. Classiﬁcation of frostbite. Frostbite has been divided into 4 “degrees” of injury . 
These are based on acute physical ﬁndings and confirm by advanced imaging after 
rewarming.  These “degrees” can be dif ﬁcult to assess in the ﬁeld and before rewarming 
because the still -frozen tissue is hard, pale, and numb . Severity of frostbite may vary 
within a single extremity.
a. First -degree frostbite presents with numbness and erythema. A white or yellow, 
ﬁrm, slightly raised plaque develops in the area of injury.There may be slig ht skin loss . 
Mild oedema is common.
b. Second -degree frostbite injury results in super ﬁcial skin blistering ; a clear or 
milky ﬂuid is present in the blisters which are surrounded by erythema and oedema. 
c. Third -degree frostbite creates deeper hemorrha gic blisters indicating that the 
injury has extended into the deep tissues . 
d. Fourth -degree frostbite injury extends deep to the skin into muscle and bone. 
26. Field treatment .If a body part is frozen in the ﬁeld, the frozen tissue should be 
protected from further damage. Ensure the skin is dry.  Remove jewe llery from the body part. 
Do not rub tissue in an attempt to re -warm.
27. Refreezing injury .A decision should be made whether or not to thaw the tissue. If 
environmental conditions are such that thawed tissue could refreeze, it is safer to keep the 
affected part frozen until a thawed state can be maintained. You must avoid refreezing if 
ﬁeld-thawing occurs.
28. Antibiotics. Allcases inwhich there isasignificant amount ofdying ordead tissue
should be considered forsystemic antibiotics andanti-tetanus prophylaxis.  Anyone with
damaged or contaminated areas offrostbite, e.g.,frostbite complicating agunshot wound,
should be started onantibiotics andhave anti-tetanus immediately (using anappropriate
antibiotic protocol) and transferred tohospital forspecialist care.  When FCIissevere, the4-8 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21risks ofanaerobic infection are significant, andgasgangrene andtetanus have killed many of
those withtheworst cold injuries inthepast.
29.Spontaneous or passive thawing .Most frostbite will thaw spontaneously and should 
be allowed to do so if rapid rewarming cannot be readily achieved. Strategies for 2 scenarios 
are presented:
a. Scenario 1 .  The frozen part has the potential of refreezing and will not be actively 
thawed .
b. Scenario 2.The frozen part can be kept thawed and warm with minimal risk of 
refreezing until evacuation is completed.
30.Therapeutic options for both Scenario s1 and 2.
a. Treatment of hypothermia .Hypothermia frequently accompanies frostbite . HTI 
(hypothermia staging) may be treated concurrently with the frostbite injury. HTII-IV
should be treated effectively before treating the frostbite injury. 
b. Hydration .Appropriate hydration isimportant in frostbite recovery and ﬂuids 
should be administered if possible. Oral ﬂuids should be given if the patient is alert. If 
the patient is nause ated, vomiting or has an altered mental status, warmed IV fluids
should be given if available. 
c. Ibuprofen .If available, ibuprofen (400-800mg TDS)should be started in the ﬁeld. 
31.Specific recommendations Scenario 1 .Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 1 
include the following:
a. Dressings .Apply if it is practical to do so and will not interf ere with mobility. 
Dressings should be applied to the frozen part and between the toes and ﬁngers.
b. Ambulation and protection .If at all possible, a frozen extremity should no t be 
used for walking, climbing or other maneuvers until de ﬁnitive care is reached. If using 
the frozen e xtremity for mobility is considered, a risk -beneﬁt analysis should consider 
the potential for further trauma and possible poorer outcomes. Although it is reasonable 
to walk on a foot with frostbitten toes for evacuation purposes, it is inadvisable to walk
on an entirely frostbitten foot because of the potential for resulting morbidity.  If using a 
frozen extremity for locomotion or evacuation is unavoidable, the extremity should be 
padded, splinted, and kept as immobile as possible to minimize additional t rauma. 
Measures should be taken to protect frozen tissue to prevent further trauma. 
32.Specific recommendations Scenario 2 .Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 2 
include the following:
a. Rapid ﬁeld rewarming of frostbite.Field rewarming by warm water bath 
immersion can and should be performed if the proper equipment and methods are 
available and de ﬁnitive care is more than 2 hours away. Field rewarming should only 
be undertaken if the frozen part can be kept thawed and wa rm until the patient arrives at 
deﬁnitive care. 
(1) Water should be heated to between 37-39°C.  If a thermometer is not 
available, a safe water temperature can be determined by placing an uninjured 4-9 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21hand in the water for at least 30 seconds to con ﬁrm thatthe water temperature is 
tolerable and will not cause burn injury.
(2) The affected limb should be suspended in circulating water.  Because the 
water may cool after the rewarming process is started, the water should be 
continually, but carefully, w armed to the target temperature.
(3)Rewarming is complete when the involved part takes on a red or purple 
appearance and becomes soft and pliable to the touch. This will take 
approximately 30 minutes but may take a longer or shorter amount of time 
depending o n the extent and depth of the injury.
(4)The affected tissues should then be allowed to air dry or gently dried with 
blotting motions to minimize further damage.
b.Pain control . During rewarming, pain medications ( e.g., NSAIDs or opiate 
analgesics) should be given to control symptoms as dictated by individual patient 
response and medication availability. 
c. Spontaneous or passive thawing .Rapid rewarming is strongly recommended.
If ﬁeld rewarming is not possible, however, spontaneous or slow thawing may be 
unavoidable and should be allowed. Slow rewarming can be accomplished b y moving 
into a warmer location and warming with adjacen t body heat from another person. 
d.Debridement of blisters .Debridement of blister s should not be routinely 
performed in the ﬁeld.If a clear, ﬂuid-ﬁlled blister is tense and at high risk for rupture 
during an evacuation, aspiration of the blister and application of a dry gauze dressing 
should be performed in the ﬁeld to minimise infection. Hemorrhagic bullae should not 
be aspirated or d ebrided electively in the ﬁeld.
e.Dressings .Substantial oedema post re -warming should be anticipated and 
circumferential dressings should be wrapped loosely to allow for swelling without 
placing pressure on the underlying tissue.
f. Ambulation and protection .A risk -beneﬁt analysis should again consider the 
potential for further trauma and, ultimately, higher morbidity if a thaw ed part is used for 
ambulation.
g.Elevation of extremity . If possible, the thawed extremity should be elevated .
h.Oxygen . Oxygen (if available) may be delivered by face mask or nasal cannula if 
the patient is hypoxic (oxyge n saturation SpO 2<90%) or the patient is at high altitude 
(>5000 m ). 4-10 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21Table 6-Summary of Field Treatment of Frostbite ( >2 hours from de ﬁnitive care)1
1. Treat hypothermia or serious injuries
2. Remove jewe lry from the body part
3.Rapidly rewarm in water heated and maintained between 37 °and 39 °C until area becomes soft and 
pliable to the touch (approximately 30 minutes). Allow spontaneous or passive thawing if rapid 
rewarming is not possible
4. Ibuprofen ( 400-800mg tds ) if availab le
5. Pain medication (opiate) as needed
6. Air dry ( i.e., do not rub at any point)
7. Protect from refreezing and direct trauma
9. Drydressings
10.Elevate the affected body part if possible
11.Maintain hydration
12.Avoid ambulation on thawed lower extremity (unless only distal toes are affected)
33.Photography. Photographs should be taken as soon as possible after injury, soon 
after thawing, and frequently therea fterto document the disease process .  Any photograph is 
useful, although high -quality clinical photographs are preferred.  Photographs should 
accompany the patient when attending any specialist review.  Photographs should be taken 
and handled in accordance with JSP 950 Part 1 Lft 2 -1-3 Defence Medical Services Clinical 
Photographic Policy .
Cold Sensitivity
34.Cold sensitivity is a common sequal aeeven to mild cold injury, both FCI and NFCI. It 
is often the presenting complaint following a cold injury.  Individuals suffering from FCI / 
NFCI should be protected from further cold exposure for at least 6 weeks , until it is proven 
they have not been cold sensitised.4-11 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21Non-Freezing Cold Injury (NFC I)3
35.Background. NFCI continue s to be a significant cause of Disease and Non -Battle 
Injury (DNBI) casualties in personnel operating in cold and/or wet environments. This has 
implications for mission success and is thus a major component of operational risk analysis.
It also has implications for future employment and deployment . The evidence -base relating 
to NFCI’s pathophysiology, risk factors, prevention, identification and diagnosis is generally 
weak, being largely drawn from small laboratory studies on animals and humans, case -based 
evidence from the field, or expert opinion. The criteria used to reach this conclusion ( Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network4,5) are not wholly appropriate for some of the areas of 
evidence associated with NFCI. Thus, the weak or absent evidence surrounding the 
understanding and clinical approach to NFCI does not necessarily mean what is thought true 
or undertaken is wrong, but rat her that the level of evidence supporting clinical activity in 
other conditions is lacking for NFCI .
36.Introduction. While local cooling of tissue to temperatures below minus 0.55°C may 
result in freezing cold injury (FCI, or frostbite ), sustained/fluc tuating tissue cooling within a 
temperature range from just above this point to approximately 20°C may cause NFCI which, 
in some cases, causes lasting debility (including numbness, paraesthesia , pain, 
hyperhidrosis, cold allodynia and proprioceptive change s resulting in gait alteration).  
Protracted and intense vasoconstriction in response to a relatively mild cold stimulus (cold 
sensitivity ) can also result. Thus, in contrast to FCI (where ambient temperature is likely to 
be below freezing), tissue temper atures associated with NFCI may occur at any ambient 
environmental temperature below 20°C (although risk rises as this ambient temperature 
falls and/or duration of exposure increases).  NFCI affects the lower limbs more frequently 
than the upper, and the d istal limb (digits) more than the proximal.  Whilst resulting symptoms 
may be minor or short -lived, long -term sequelae may result.  Whilst these can be 
asymptomatic, they can also cause symptoms, which can sometimes prove intractable and 
debilitating. 
37.Pathogenesis. NFCI pathogenesis is poorly understood.  Data are largely derived from 
case -based accounts, and from animal models o f uncertain relevance to human patho -
physiology.  Human longitudinal histopathological data are completely lacking.  Howeve r, it 
appears likely that impaired microvascular flow leads to neurovascular damage, resultant 
upon ischaemia/hypoxia and/or ischaemia -reperfusion injury.  These two elements (neural 
and vascular injury) may interact, microvascular damage causing neural is chaemic injury, 
and damage to microvascular innervations leading to further ischaemia.  There is also 
evidence that cold causes direct damage to nerve fibres, independent of ischaemia d ue to 
vascular damage.
38.  NFCI is best considered as a clinical syndrome of varying severity and time course, with 
some patients showing full resolution of symptoms within days, and others persisting for 
years.  It is not yet possible to predict, from initial symptoms and signs at presentation, which 
patients will fall into which prognostic group.

b. Pale extremities +/ -cyanosis or mottling.
c. Loss of sensation.
d. Altered sensation, for exampl e burning/tingling/pins and needles.
e. Swelling of hands or feet may occur, but infrequently.
40.Re-warming symptoms.
a. Hands and feet take longer than normal to re -warm.
b. Red, hyperaemic hands or feet.
c. Pain, often described as throbbing, stabbing, and painful pins and needles, but as 
with all neuropathic pain the individual may have difficulty describing the character.
d. Loss of sensation.
e. Altered sensation, in particular individuals often notice that they cannot sense 
temperature well and that feet or hands feel particularly hot in a shower or bath. 
f. Swelling of hands or feet in more severe cases.
41.Persistent symptoms .
a. Loss of sensation.
b. Altered sensation.
c. Possibly increased sweating; it is not yet clea r whether a true hyperhidrosis may 
follow NFCI, or whether it is a sense of the foot feeling wet due to neuropathy.
d. Cold sensitivity may develop at any point during the 6 weeks following injury, but 
does not happen in all cases of NFCI, conversely cold sensitivity may exist without 
NFCI.
e. Cold sensitivity is an unusual response to a cold environment and may include 
either or both neurological and vascular symptoms such as hands and feet feeling cold 
in relatively temperate environments or taking much longer than normal to re -warm 
following cold exposure. 
42.It should be noted that individuals who report full symptomatic recovery may 
nevertheless have persistent nerve and/or vascular damage and thus be more vulnerable to 
injury with further cold exposure and may therefore require medical limitations to 
employment. Individuals who show full recovery of symptoms and have a normal NFCI 
examination within one week of injury may be cautiously re -exposed to cold environments 
with a very low threshold for removing them from risk should they develop symptoms. All 
other individuals should be put on restricted duties , including change of JMES where 
appropriate, and refer red to a ROHT Regional NFCI clinic for assessment.4-13 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 2143.Predisposing factors. Cold injury rates are higher in the untrained and the young (16 -
19 years)6.Preventive strategies in support of the Chain of Command (Section 3) should be 
uppermost. African -Caribbean/Pacific -Islander personnel also have a different physiological 
response to cold7and as such may be at higher risk of cold injury8.  Those individuals should 
be aware of this risk and be extra vigilant to maintaining the ir cold weather skills.  In addition ,
medical personnel should be proactive in highlighting high -risk personnel to the Chain of 
Command .
44.The importance of core temperature. Cutaneous blood flow (CuBF) falls in response 
to cooling, an effect, which is amplified by a reduction in deep body temperature.  However, 
cooling extremities to approximately 10°C results in cyclical increases in CuBF -a 
phenomenon known as cold -induced vasodilatation (CIVD) or the ‘hunting response’, which 
may help protect tissues from ischaemic/hypoxic injury.  A normal (or above -normal) deep 
body temperature is essential for the CIVD response and a reduced CIVD response may be 
associated with increased risk of cold -injury.  
45.Future risk afte r NFCI. At present, a validated test of known (and appropriate) 
sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive power for NFCI development does not exist9.  
Those with severe and established (post -hyperaemic phase) NFCI who go on to demonstrate 
cold sensitivity, neuropathy and hyperhidrosis would appear to have physiological reason to 
be at greater risk of future NFCI, although the magnitude of this risk increase (and the extent 
to which it can be mitigated) i s unclear. 
46.Diagnosis. A working diagnosis of NFCI should be made in Primary Healthcare by 
nominated NFCI clinicians and will be based upon comprehensive history, standardised 
clinical examination and specialist tests10. Complaints of persistent numb ness, tingling, 
burning or pins and needles in his hands or feet, or any other peripheral body part, during 
cool and particularly wet conditions are consistent with NFCI.  Possible alternative diagnoses 
for NFCI are Raynaud’s phenomenon , Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome, and care should be 
taken not to overlook other differential diagnoses such as sickle cell disease, sinus tarsi 
syndrome and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
a. History. This should focus on: 
(1) Obtaining a detailed account of the circumstances lea ding to the NFCI, 
including environmental conditions (ambient temperature, precipitation, relative 
wind speed, activity, body insulation and available shelter, food and fluid 
availability), any predisposing factors and the number of others (if any) injured in 
6Defence Statistics (Health) report to Cold Injuries Working Group, 5Jan17. Rates are highest for 16 -19 age group for all years over the 
five-year period (2011/12 to 2015/16). Rates are highest for untrained personnel across all years over the five -year period.

Medicine.

9The suggestion that NFCI can result in persistent changes in microcirculatory regulation and ongoing peripheral sensory neuro pathy in 
association with hyperhidrosis (which can increase surface cooling) make it plausible t hat past NFCI might elevate the risk of future 
NFCI.  There is thus a physiological rationale to suggest that past NFCI might elevate future risk.  However, proof that past NFCI 
elevates future risk is lacking.  The magnitude of any attributable risk, even if suspected, thus remains unquantified.  
10Paragraph 12 of the March 2015 Independent Med ical Expert Group (IMEG) report to Armed Forces Compensation Scheme states 
that neither Infra -red Thermography (IRT) or Thermal Threshold Testing (TTT) may be regarded as diagnostic and, at paragraphs 14 -
17, stresses the importance of a diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy (SFN) in the overall diagnosis of NFCI. Paragraph 20 states that 
'NFCI should be diagnosed from the combination of clinical history, clinical examination and special tests ’ and, at paragraph 23, in 
general ' The clinical features of chronic NFCI include persistent abnormal vascular thermal reactivity and a sensory neuropathy 
affecting solely or predominantly small nerve fibres and giving rise to chronic continuous or intermittent neuropathic pain, frequently 
accompanied by cold allodynia ’.4-14 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21same incident.  Timings (including durations of exposures and onset of symptoms) 
should also be recorded.
(2) Clinical features of the affected part at the time of exposure and upon 
rewarming, and their subsequent progression.
b. Examination. For the majority of those injured there are often surprisingly few 
objective clinical signs.  Therefore, the following specific information should be sought: 
(1) Cutaneous features.
(a) Skin initially appearing pale/white/blotchy with prolonged nail bed 
capillary refilling time without evidence of swelling.
(b) Skin acquiring a mottled blue appearance with rising temperature in the 
hours and days after rewarming. 
(c) Skin becoming hot and flushed with the possibility of:
i. Oedema and blistering in t he hyperaemic phase (days to months) 
ii. Hyperhidrosis after the first few weeks. 
(2)Impact on peripheral pulses. A vascular assessment, including that of 
pulses and capillary refill time, should be performed.
(3)Neurological features. Impaired se nsory and motor function over hours to 
days after exposure.  Neurological examination should include an assessment of 
gait, and of large fibre sensory modalities (light touch, 2 -point discrimination, 
vibration sense and joint position sense) and small fibr e modalities (pin prick, 
heat and cold), with a note of the presence or absence of cold allodynia.
c. Investigation11.A validated test of known (and appropriate) sensitivity and 
specificity in diagnosing NFCI does not exist.  Patients should be investig ated in 
accordance with their symptomatology.  For example ,a patient with signs consistent 
with peripheral neuropathy should be referred for appropriate neurological testing.  
47.Clinical care pathway12. Routine clinical management of suspected NFCI w ill be 
managed in accordance with the clinical care pathway outlined below and DPHC Guidance 
Note No. 14/17.This will enable appropriate initial management and referral of suspected 
NFCI patients, ensuring consistent advice and compliance with Joint poli cy.  All 
assessments of suspected NFCI cases and their subsequent management should be 
carried out in accordance with guidance in the relevant DMICP template. DPHC NFCI 
Clinic staff will support GPs, reinforce best practice and to support the Chain of Command in 
their efforts to minimise further harm to personnel at risk.  The following tiers of care should
be followed:
11All specialist tests should be reported in a standardised format, which does not ‘confirm’ or ‘refute’ a diagnosis of NFCI, rather relays 
the results of the tests themselves.
12There is an almost complete absence of well -conducted case -control or cohort s tudies to support any of the information presented in 
this section.  Instead, most of the treatment regimens and advice that exist are based on per sonal experience or observation .4-15 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21a. Tier 1A -NFCI field ca re.
(1) Management. If NFCI is suspected, you should :
(a) Remove the patient from the risk environment13. Shelter the patient and 
dry affected feet and/or hands replacing wet socks or gloves as needed.  
Provide supplementary whole -body insulation.  
(b)Intake of fluids ma y help peripheral perfusion where dehydration is a 
contributory factor to its impairment.  ‘Sweet fluids’, by increasing calorie 
intake, may help improve perfusion and ability to generate heat though 
exercise or shivering where this is a factor14.
(c) In contrast to patients with FCI, those with NFCI should always have 
their affected parts re -warmed slowly , by exposure to warm air alone, and 
should not be immersed in water8,15.If necessary, only use paracetamol 
and/or ibuprofen for pain control. If there is any visible evidence of tissue 
damage, protocols for FCI should be followed.  
(d) Alert the Chain of Command that there has been a cold injury during the 
activity -others may also be at risk.
(e) Evacuate the patient to safety immediately.  Do not allow them to return 
to the cold environment even if they appear to have recovered.
(f) Arrange a routine appointment with a MO, preferably one with 
experience in man aging NFCI.  If the patient has significant skin changes, 
cannot walk or their pain i s not controlled by paracetamol and/or ibuprofen 
alone an urgent appointment is required.
(2) Recording. You should record the episode on the DMICP NFCI template16: 
b. Tier 1B -NFCI primary c are.
(1) Management.
(a) Manage pain.
(b) Advise the patient to use warm foot/hand spas (30 min / 40°C / twice 
daily), if appropriate17. 
13In the deployed setting, those with a significant NFCI (or FCI -excluding frostnip) should normally be evacuated to their parent unit once 
their condition has stabilised.  Where a decision is made to retain such patients in the deployed setting then appr opriate safeguards should 
be put in place to avoid further cold exposure.  Care should be taken to ensure that personnel being evacuated back to UK are referred to 
an appropriate medical facility / specialist for continuation of treatment when necessary.  This is especially important when the responsible 
primary care provider remains deployed.
14There are no data to show that intake of small volumes of hot fluid affect deep body temperature more than marginally, nor th at they lead 
to vasodilatation through any other mechanism.  Thus, whilst comforting to drink warm fluids (with the possible advantage of cradling a 
warm cup if hands are affected, and increasing the ability to dissolve sugar), maintaining hydration per se might seem more important, whilst 
calories can be ingested in a variety of other forms.
15The early period after re -warming can be exquisitely painful in NFCI even without any obvious tissue damage and may require strong oral 
analgesia.  The pressure of bedclothes may cause pain, so a bed crad le may be helpful.
16See guidance at Section 5 -Reporting and Recording.
17The timing of warm spa use is important.  NFCI in the acute setting should NOT be rapidly rewarmed and whilst in the hyperaemic phase 
this may actually cause pain and possibly make the situation worse.  It should be reserved for those with on -going neuropathy and those 
with cold sensitivity.4-16 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21(c) Advise the patient on appropriate use of clothing and footwear.
(d) Authorise issue of extreme cold weather ( ECW )hat and mittens.
(e) Advise smokers on benefits of cessation.
(f) Request bloods: FBC, U&Es, LFTs, random glucose, HbA1c, B12, 
folate, thyroid screen, auto -antibody screen and (if appropriate) 
haemoglobinopathy screen.
(g) Advise on appropriate occupational restrictions and c onsid er amending 
JMES in accordance with JSP 950 Part 1 Leaflet 6 -7-7 Joint Manual of 
Medical Fitness Section 5 Annex N Other Conditions .  Issue the NFCI 
specific PAP10 App 9 (Army only) in accordance with clinical progression.
(h) Prompt the Chain of Command to complete a single Service incident 
form (patient consent required).
(i) Where there is not recovery within one week refer the patient to the 
DPHC NFCI Clinics (including INM CIC as tier 2) ,using a DMICP e -referral.  
Existing photographic records should be sent separately to the latter.  
Suspicion of compromised tissue viabilit y should be discussed with the 
DPHC NFCI Clinic and local surgical services as a matter of urgency.
(j) Thereafter, review as clinically indicated and await DPHC NFCI Clinic 
appointment.  
(k) At any time, consider referring the patient into the Defence Medical 
Rehabilitation Programme18.
(2) Recording. The episode should be recorded on DMICP .
c. Tier 2 -DPHC NFCI or INM CI clinic.
(1) Management. If NFCI is suspected:
(a) You should make a working diagnosis of NFCI.
(b) You should make recommendation to award the appropriate JMES, if 
not already done (to be discuss edwith ROHT).
(c) Patients should be issued with a NFCI Patient Information Leaflet.  
(d) After establishing a baseline of any cold damage/sensitisation, patients 
should be followed up as appropriate (at 6 -12weeks, 26 weeks and 1-year
post-injury) to assess the progress of recovery, provide advice on likely long -
term residual sequelae and info rm future employability limitations.  If the 
patient is seen more than one year following the index injury, then only one 
18Especially useful for improvement of functional ability, pain management and for the development of psychosocial coping mecha nisms.4-17 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21attendance may be needed.
(e) Arrange for referral to a Specialist if needed.19
(f) Consider referring the patient into the Defence Medical Rehabilitation 
Programme20.
(2) Recording. The episode should be recorded on DMICP7.
d. Tier 3 -specialist referral. Cases with mild to moderate signs and symptoms of 
NFCI may be managed locally by suitably experienced medical staff utilising the ROHT 
or nominated DPHC Regional L ead for advice. More severe cases, or those in which 
symptoms are persistent, should be referred for tertiary assessment and care as 
appropriate, including: DMRC Headley Court for pain management; the NHS for 
specialist neurological assessment; or to the Cold Injury Clini c (CIC), INM.  Referrals to 
these clinics should be arranged by DPHC NFCI or INM CI Clinics only and in 
accordance with DPHC G uidance Note No. 10/17 .
(1) Clinical assessment against the criteria below will indicate which patients 
need onward referral wher e sequelae are persistent or problematic to treat, or 
where there remain questions over employment limitations:
(a) Persistent numbness or neuropathic pain, particularly overnight or other 
symptoms of persistent sensory loss especially temperature sensati on.  
Sensory loss is sometimes indicated by a change of gait or evidence of a 
functional limitation or restriction. 
(b) Evidence of tissue damage, such as skin discolouration changes and 
trophic changes to nailbeds . 
(c) A newly acquired cold sensitivit y, i.e. increased sensation of cold on 
exposure to a cold environment.  
The above criteria are not exhaustive and further advice can be provided by INM or 
DPHC Leads. 
(2) Cold Injury Clinic, INM. Those patients referred to the CIC will undertake a 
standardised prognostic test battery, including a neurological examination and 
assessment, thermal sensory thresholds and cold sensitivity to help inform the 
patient’s future medical employability.  
48.Pain management.
a. Transient re -warming pain lasting less than an hour or two during re -warming is 
generally benign.  More prolonged pain, particularly overnight, may indicate that the 
injury is likely to be non -freezing.  It is common clinical experience that neuropathic pa in 
responds poorly to non -opioid analgesics.  However, there are no reported randomised 
clinical trials (RCT) of treatment for pain resulting from NFCI. 
19By a suitably qualified physician
20Especially useful for improvement of functional ability, pain management and for the development of psychosocial coping mecha nisms.4-18 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21b. See Annex C -Management of Pain in Non Freezing Cold Injury (NFCI) and 
Consult the DMRC Neuropathic Pain and Medication –Teaching Guide for Primary Care 
Clinicians .  Clinicians can also e mail DMRC Pain Clinic for advice at DMRC -Pain 
Management (MULTIUSER) DMRC -PainManagement@mod.gov.uk
c. Medic ation used in the management of NFCI pain are commonly associated with 
adverse effects that m ay outweigh any analgesic benefit derived.  For example, patients 
should be warned that amitriptyline may cause marked drowsiness (this usually wears 
off after the first few days) and hypertension (blood pressure should be checked prior to 
initial use and regularly thereafter).  Patients should be made aware of the other side 
effects and important warnings associated with this (and any other) drug before use in 
the military setting.  Use of any sedative medication will require appropriate restriction 
on emp loyment.
d. Regular clinical reviews to assess and monitor the effectiveness of the treatment 
are essential.  Each review should include and assessment of:
(1)Adequacy of control measures aimed at protection from cold conditions.
(2)Pain control –including assessment and appropriate pain score.
(3)Impact on lifestyle, daily activities (including sleep disturbance) and 
employment.
(4)Physical and psychological wellbeing.
(5)Adverse effects.
(6)Continued need for treatment.
49.Hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis of the feet and hands is a common secondary issue that 
can affect the recovery and longer -term management of both significant FCI and NFCI, but 
especially the latter (see para graph 41c).  Treatment of severe hyperhidrosis can be difficult; 
whilst topical application of aluminium and similar salts by spray or roll -on can eliminate 
sweating for short periods, and may thus be useful for critical tasks, this is unsuitable for 
frequent use.  Patients with hyperhidrosis sufficient to interfere with activities of daily living or 
their job should be discussed with the DPHC NFCI Clinic with a view to referral for specialist 
dermatological opinion.  Sympathectomy (either through a temporary block or permanent 
surgical methods) is inapprop riate for hyperhidrosis and should not be used to manage 
hyperhidrosis (or symptoms of chronic pain) in NFCI cases, as these individuals tend to have 
a poor outcome.
50.Employability. Once a patient has returned to their parent unit, re -exposure to the cold 
and / or wet should only be permitted with caution.  In general, those who have suffered 
significant NFCI will need an appropriate JMES for at least the winter after they sustained 
their injury.  They may be employed in sheltered environmental conditi ons (for example, 
working indoors in heated buildings only).  Patients who are completely asymptomatic, with 
no suggestion of cold sensitivity and normal neurological examination ,can be progress ively 
re-introduced to the cold. Ifthey show signs of sequel ae or recurrence, the re -introduction 
should be terminated at once.  Measures to be considered for the on -going occupational 
management of those who have sustained cold injury include:4-19 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21a. Avoidance of exposure to cold and/or wet conditions.
b. Restrictio n to working outdoors only when it is warm and dry21.
c. Confinement to indoor working (in properly heated buildings) at all other times.
d. Issue with warm hand -and footwear (the latter including Arctic socks and 
specialist boots if necessary).
e. Ensuring that the patient is encouraged to wear such clothing when they feel a 
need rather than in accordance with prevailing dress policy.
f. Daily or more frequent re -warming us ing a foot spa13,22.
g. Assiduous foot -care routines, and a high standard of personal care in field -craft.
51.For personnel undergoing initial training (both Phase 1 and Phase 2 for the Army) these 
restrictions may not be possible to implement.  Those t rainees with anything more than the 
most trivial NFCI that resolves rapidly post -injury are unlikely to be able to complete training.
52.JMES. Patients with persistent NFCI should be graded and appropriate occupational 
restrictions applied i n accordance with JSP 950 Part 1 Leaflet 6 -7-7 Joint Manual of Medical 
Fitness Section 5 Annex N Other Conditions until reviewed by an Occupational Medicine 
Consultant23and only after all necessar y referrals have been completed.  Patients with 
significant sequel ae limiting their employability and deployability should remain in a restricted 
JMES until full recovery is established24.The JMES of personnel undergoing initial training 
(both Phase 1 and Phase 2 for the Army) should be discussed with the sS Occupational 
Physician responsible for providing advice to training establishments.
53.Re-exposure to cold .
a. Trained strength. NFCI may recover sufficiently quickly that patients can be 
returned to full duties at around the 3 -5 month point.  Although it has bee n common 
practice in the past to shelter those patients from severe cold exposure for the following 
winter (for instance, not deploying to Norway for approximately 12 months), those with a 
normal neurological examination who remain asymptomatic during the onset of the 
following winter can be re -exposed provided that they, and their Chain of Command , 
should adopt a c autious appro ach to re -exposing the individual.  Both the Chain of 
Command and the individual should remain alert to and act upon the recurrence of 
symptoms.
b. Un-trained strength. This group needs to be assessed against the requirements 
of their remaining training and against their likely future duties on the trained strength.  
Unless the trainee is entirely asymptomatic, with a normal neurological examination and 
no persistent sk in changes they should be assessed by the consultant in occupational 
21Judgement must be exercised in determining ongoing exposure to cold conditions.  For example, even on a cold day many NFCI patients 
will be able to go for a run providing they leave a warm environment, return immediately to a warm environment and wear appro priate 
footwear/clothing.  Some units experience difficulties employing NFCI patien ts by recommending that they avoid many fitness and exercise 
training opportunities because of a misplaced concern about further exposure.
22Empirical evidence only.
23Dedicated ROMCs are responsible for recommending appropriate JMES awards for SPs with a diagnosis of NFCI.
24Medical grading reviews should be carried out in accordance with sS policy.4-20 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 21medicine for recruits, and ROHT NFCI clinic as indicated, but they may not necessarily
bereturned to normal training.  
54.Advice and information for patients. As a minimum, patients25who have suffered 
suspected NFCI should be provided with a patient information leaflet and an Indiv iduals 
Guide to Climatic Injury26.
25Including patients who are sent on sick leave, or who may otherwise present to civilian medical services, Civilian medical services should 
be encouraged to seek advice and support from NFCI Regional Secondary Care Clinics.

1. Reporting and/or recording of heat illness and cold injury is known to be an area of poor 
compliance in both Command and Medical chains.  All cases of climatic illness/injury must be 
reported and/or recorded by both the:
a. Chain of Command in accordance with JSP 375 Volume 1 Chapters 41 or 42.
b. Medical chain in accordance with paragraph s 9-11.
2. Each cha in serves a different but comple mentary purpose, and both are seen as 
essential to mitigating risk.  Improvements in reporting of climatic illness/injury will have 
practical benefits for personnel .  The better the scale and nature of the problem of 
illness/injury within Defence is understood the better Defence can take steps to minimi se the 
risk of climatic illness/injury occurring.  It will also help inform the provision of improved 
systems of training and treatment so that illness/injury is better recognised and treated when 
it does occur and is crucial to the monitoring of the effectiv eness of this JSP. 
3. It is important that all confirmed or suspected heat illness/ cold injury cases ,are 
reported.  Where there are multiple casualties or any fatalities an appropriate investigation 
must be undertaken. A functional, rapid, local alert mechanism, whereby all local units 
undertaking similar activities are made awar e all incidents of climatic illness/injury as they 
arise, must be incorporated into the dynamic risk assessment process. Unit medical centres 
are to be notified by the CoC of all reported cases of heat illness and cold injury to ensure 
appropriate medical follow -up and recording takes place.
4.Reporting and /orrecording of heat illness/ cold injury must comply with:
a. Statute e.g.Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, RIDDOR1. 
b. Defence Lessons Identified Management System (DLIMS).
c. Joint and Single Service (sS) reporting .
d. Medical case recording.
Chain of Command reporting
5.Reporting threshold. All cases must be reported; this includes cases where
individuals develop temporary or permanent incapacitation i.e.are unable to continue with 
their duties/training because of climatic illness/injury with or without the involvement of 
Defence Medical Services or other medical assets . 
6.Commanding Officer s (COs) must be aware that medical case recording does not 
replace their duty to report all cases of heat illness/ cold injury meeting the reporting 
threshold .Specific reporting or data collation may also be required by the Chain of 
Command in specific Op Orders or Mounting Instructions.
1RIDDOR -Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 .(accessed Nov 20).  RIDDOR t ype incidents are 
reported and captured within the MOD’s own internal reporting cells, who then centrally report such incident to the HSE if th ey fall within the 
agreed categories.5-2 JSP 539 Part 2 V3.3 Feb 217.Statutory and Service incident reporting . The C Omust ensure that suitable local
