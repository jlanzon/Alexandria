Foreword 
 
Sound appraisal and ev aluation is the key to providin g clear and transparent support for 
Evidence-Based Decision Making. Appraisal is the means by which the Department’s 
policy objective of achieving Value for Money is demonstrat ed. Evaluation of projects, 
programmes and policies post-im plementation is important to  ensure good practice is 
perpetuated and lessons are learned.  I am pleased to present this updated guide, prepared by the Appraisal and Evaluation team within Defence Economics. JSP 507 pr omulgates the policy requirements and 
comprehensive practical guidance for undertaking appraisal and evaluation, and 
supplements the HM Treasury Green Book – Appraisal and Evaluation in Central 
Government. Whilst in the main intended for pr actitioners, this guide will also help non-
practitioners to further their understanding of these tools for decision making. 
 I commend it to you and your staff.

JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) iPreface 
 
How to use this JSP  
 
1. JSP 507 is intended as a practical han dbook on the application of appraisal and 
evaluation in the MOD. It is designed to be used by staff responsible for producing 
appraisals, and planning and carry ing out project evaluations . It is also for those 
overseeing, scrutinising, and re viewing appraisals and evaluat ion plans. The JSP contains 
advice on the processes involved and the tec hniques to apply when preparing appraisals 
and evaluations. 
 
2. The JSP is structured in two parts: 
 
a.
 Part 1 - Directive, which provides direction that must be followed, in 
accordance with Statute, or Policy m andated by Defence or on Defence by 
Central Governement. 
b.
 Part 2  Guidance, which provides t he guidance that will assist the user to 
comply with the Directive. 
 
Training 
 
3.
 No guide or manual can gi ve all the answers. Training in  investment appraisals is 
provided by the Defence Academy who regular ly run a two-day training course called 
‘Investment Appraisal Skills’ (E 043). All staff tasked with undertaki ng an IA for the first time 
should attend this or a similar course. Some TLBs operate their own IA training courses. 
 
4. The Financial Skills Ce rtificate (FSC) includes elements covering Investment 
Appraisal and Evaluation. Idea lly, all IAs should be underta ken or reviewed by an 
individual with Intermediate Level FSC ce rtificate in Investment Appraisal.

1 The Principles of Appraisal and 
Evaluation 
 
This chapter explains what appraisal and evaluat ion are, and what they are for. It explains 
why appraisals and evaluations need to be objec tive and well planned, and that special 
care and consultation with Defence Economics is needed for cases going to Ministers. 
 
An investment appraisal shoul d be undertaken whenever a decision has to be reached 
which would involve the commitm ent of resources, or which would result in measurable 
benefits. Appraisal enabl es decisions to be made with a clear unders tanding of the costs 
and benefits of different choices. 
 
The depth of appraisal should be commensurate with the scale, complexity, and sensitivity 
of the project, programme, or policy being appraised. An appraisa l that covers all the steps 
in this guide is required when  the capital investment exceeds  £1M, or where total resource 
consumption over the planning period exceeds £10M. Some form of appraisal should be 
carried out on all expenditure proposals. 
 
All projects, programmes, and policies requiri ng an investment apprai sal should also be 
subject to subsequent evaluation. Plans fo r this should accompany the investment 
appraisal. 
 
 
What is Appraisal? 
 
1. Appraisal or Investment Appraisal (IA) is so called because its techniques have 
been developed mainly in the context of investment decisions. However, appraisal is equally applicable to decisions w here no investment is involved. 
 2. Appraisal
 is a systematic process which entails being clear about the 
requirement, thinking about alternative ways of  meeting the requirement, and estimating 
and presenting the costs and benefits of each pot entially worthwhile option. It enables 
decisions about the use of resources or t he generation of benefits to be taken with a better 
knowledge of their implications. 
 
Why Appraisal Matters 
 
3. In large measure public administration is about choice s.  Ultimately choices are 
made by Ministers or within a framework set by them. Ministers need the means to take 
informed decisions however, and it is government policy that investment appraisal 
techniques should be applied to major decisions involving the commitment of public funds. 
Government Accounting says:   
 “Investment appraisal (or more generally option appr aisal) is an important part of 
good financial management, and it should always be applied to major capital 
developments.” 
 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 1 
4. 
PUS, as Principal Accounting Officer,  is answerable to Parliament, through the 
Secretary of State for Defence, for the effi cient and effective use of  MOD resources, and 
appears before the Public Accounts Committee to  answer for the use of MOD resources. If 
decisions can be shown to be based on sound and thorough appraisals, and are properly 
evaluated, then the position of the Accounting Officer is protected. 
 
The Purpose of Appraisal 
 
5. An investment appraisal serves three main purposes. 
 
a. Its prime function is to give the responsible manager the information he or she 
needs to make a sound decision. As such, appraisal is an essential part of the search for best value for money. 
b. When a decision is outs ide the manager’s delegated au thority, then an appraisal 
will need to be presented as part of a submission for approval, and will form an 
important part of the case for gaining approval. A thorough appraisal that is well 
documented and presented will help to demonstrate that the project is soundly 
based and will smooth the proc ess of gaining approval. 
c. The appraisal also provides a record of what was expected to be achieved by the 
project and the factors on which the dec ision was based. It will be an important 
starting point for any later review or aud it of the project, and in particular for 
project evaluation. 
 6. The aim is not to reduce decision taking to mere mechanics, but rather to place it 
on a rational and informed basis in which decisi ons are taken with a cl ear understanding of 
the costs and benefits of the available options. 
 
Value for Money 
 7. In pursuing policy objectives, the objec tive of all public sector bodies is to 
achieve Value for Money (Vf M) defined as optimising net so cial costs and benefits.  The 
assessment of value is based upon the interests of society as a whole rather than to MOD 
or the public sector alone (see Pa rt 2, Chapter 5, paragraph 27). 
 VfM can be defined as the optimal combination of:  
a. Economy – i.e. Cost of Inputs (I/M : Inputs/Money) 
b. Efficiency – i.e. Ratio of Out put to Inputs (O/I  : Outputs/Inputs 
c. Effectiveness – i.e. Value of Outcomes  from Outputs (V/O : Value/Outputs) 
 Hence VfM = I/M  x  O/I  x  V/O  =  V/M (Value / Money) 
 8. VfM can also be expressed as the opt imal trade-off between time, cost and 
effectiveness. This does not necessarily mean choosing the lowest cost bid, nor highest 
performance regardless of the consequences.  VfM is derived using the methodology set 
out in this Guide to provide a through life cost expressed in Ne t Present Value (NPV) 
terms considered alongside other significant  factors that have not been possible to 
sensibly value (see Part 2, Chapter 5).  9. VfM is a relative concept which involv es the comparison of potential and actual 
outcomes of alternative procurement options. VfM is only meaningful  where options exist. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 2 
Where there is only one opti on then there is no real way of assessing VfM and in thes
e 
circumstances the key is to achieve the most acceptable cost. 
 
The Main Forms of Appraisal 
 
10. As Government bodies  are concerned with the we ll-being of the country; 
appraisals carried out by Government Depar tments will normally be prepared on the basis 
of the costs and benefits of usi ng national resources. Here t he cost is the ‘opportunity 
cost’, or loss of the alternative use to whic h those resources could be put (see Part 2, 
chapter 1, paragraph 35). Transfers  of cash for which no goods or services are provided in 
return (called ‘transfer payment s’) are not included (see Part 2, Chapter 1, paragraph 47). 
These appraisals are called ‘ Economic Appraisals ’. 
 11. In some cases economic appr aisals will take the form of a COST BENEFIT 
ANALYSIS (CBA) , in which all of the costs and benefits of an ac tivity are quantified and 
valued in monetary terms. The results of a CBA can be used not only to say which option 
is best, but also to indicate whether this option is worthwhile, i.e. does it provide a benefit exceeding its cost.  
Example  
 
The Health and Safety Executive produces CBAs of all proposals for new health and 
safety regulations. This involves estimating t he extra cost employers will face in complying 
with the requirement, and the b enefits in terms of reduced lik elihood of deaths, injuries, 
illness and interruptions to work. These benef its are then given a monetary value based on 
the results of research into the costs of  accidents and peoples’ wi llingness to pay to 
reduce the risk of death and injury. The net pr esent value of the difference between the 
costs and benefits can then be calculated. 
  
12. As few activities withi n MOD produce benefits that can be valued in monetary 
terms, the use of full-blown CBA by MOD is extremely limited. One of  the few areas where 
a CBA would be useful would be proposed health and safety or environmental measures 
that go beyond statutory requi rements. Defence Economics should be consulted as to 
whether and how a CBA might be prepared in such cases. 
 13. Instead, most MOD apprai sals take the form of a COST EFFECTIVENESS 
ANALYSIS (CEA) , which estimates the net present cost  of alternative ways of achieving 
the same requirement. When there are differences  in the extent to which the requirement 
is achieved, these will be no ted, and as far as possible quant ified, using measures which 
may be judgemental.  14. By including the status quo in the co mparison of options, a CEA can establish 
whether any alternative
 option is worthwhile, as well as  which option is best. It cannot 
though, on its own, establish whether t he activity itself is worthwhile. 
 15. A highly formalised type of CEA is used  for appraisal of new military equipment, 
and for other appraisals where the options to m eet a requirement offer different levels of 
military or business effectiveness. This is the COMBINED OPERATIONAL 
EFFECTIVENESS AND INVESTMENT APPRAISAL (COEIA) . Here, the total through-life 
costs of the options to meet  a particular requirement are estimated in the Investment 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 3 
Appraisal. The individ ual parameters contributing to ov
erall performance are identified, and 
each option assessed against each of these param eters in the Operational Effectiveness  
 
Assessment. The two separate assessments are t hen combined to identify the overall cost 
effectiveness of each option. Gu idance on COEIAs is provided in Part 2, chapter 2. 
 
When an Investment Apprai sal Should Be Undertaken 
 16. An investment appraisal should be under taken whenever a decision has to be 
reached which would involve the commitment of  resources; or which would result in 
measurable benefits. Examples include: 
 
a. a new recruitment policy, b. a works or accommodation project, c. an equipment procurement, d. a suggested redeployment, e. estate rationalisation, f. support for military exercises; g. “spend to save” measures. 
 17. The depth of appraisal and the effort applied should be commensurate with the 
scale, complexity, and sensitivity of the project, programme, or policy.  
Investment Appraisal Thresholds 
 Criteria Threshold 
Capital Investment Exceeds £1M 
Total resource consumption over 
Planning Review period Exceeds £10M (excluding depreciation and cost of 
capital charges) 
Novel or Contentious expenditure 
(see JSP 462) All proposals regardless of value 
18. An appraisal that covers  all the steps described in th is Guide is required where 
the capital investment, i.e. ex penditure on new assets, or on refurbishing existing assets, 
exceeds £1M; or where total resource consumption, i.e. operating costs (excluding depreciation and cost of capital charge), is expected to ex ceed £10M over the planning 
period. This is an approximate guide only; the presumption should normally be in favour of 
a full appraisal for borderline cases, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise. 
However, expenditure proposals below this leve l shou
 ld still be subject to a business case 
that will need to address the same basic questions as thos e addressed in an investment 
appraisal.   
 
Example  
 
Suppose it is proposed to use a building with a book value of £4M as accommodation for a 
group of relocated staff. New IT will be installed at a cost of £0.5M. Total resource costs of 
the organisation being relocated will be £2.5M p.a.  
 
For IA threshold purposes, the cost of new capital is £0.5M, (new assets, inclusive of 
project management fees), and woul d not need a full IA.  But tota l of costs in the planning 
period is £10M hence a full investment appraisal is required. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 4 
 
19. 
Senior Finance Officers (SFOs) have di scretion to set lower limits for mandatory 
appraisal. Where SFOs decide to apply lower limits for mandat ory appraisal, these should 
be followed. It remains the case that the basic  principles of appraisa l should be applied to 
all investment decisions, what ever threshold is set. There may well be cases below the 
threshold where an appraisal co vering all the steps described in  this Guide is appropriate 
because of the complexity or sensitivity of the project.  
Who is Responsible for Under taking Investment  Appraisals? 
 20. Effective appraisal, evaluation and scrutiny ar e fundamental requirements of HM 
Treasury delegations and spendi ng authority. Investment Appr aisal is a key part of the 
management decision-making process, and not me rely a finance or audit responsibility.  
  21. SFOs are responsible to DG Finance fo r the coverage and quality of investment 
appraisal throughout their area of  responsibility. They should make arrangements for 
monitoring, and should make sure  that they are made aware of any decision which runs 
counter to the conclusions of an investment  appraisal, and any case where significant 
expenditure is to be committ ed without appraisal. They are required to cover investment 
appraisal in their annual reports to DG Finance on Corporate Governance in their area. 
 22. Within TLBs, appraisals should be carried out by the line management area 
responsible for implementing the project, programme or policy. Additionally, where projects 
span TLB boundaries, responsibility for the appraisa l lies with the lead TLB. Advice should 
be sought as required from fi nance staff, TLB Appraisal and Evaluation teams, Defence 
Economics, and other specialists.  
Planning 
 23. It is important that appraisal is carried out in an open minded and objective 
manner, rather than used to support a decision which has already been made . The 
appraisal should be carefully planned. The sponsor should ensure that the necessary 
resources are provided to carry out a thorough appraisal at the right time. 
 24. As part of the pl anning process the sponsor needs to consider who should be 
consulted and when, and to allow adequate time for this cons ultation. It is good practice to 
identify who will be involved in the eventual approval of the project, and to make sure that 
their staffs are consulted on the appraisal in  draft and are content with it. That should 
reduce the risk of having to respond at shor t notice to queries or objections which are 
raised on the final submission, when a decision is needed urgently.  25. Care should be taken not to constrai n unduly the conduct of  the appraisal, for 
example by setting terms of reference that specify particular options, or a particular 
appraisal timescale. 
 
Cases for Ministers 
 
26. Particular care is needed in cases t hat go to Ministers for their approval. The 
investment involved may be quite small in  financial terms, but these cases can be 
sensitive - because they involve redundancies or impact on the local economy, or because there is political interest in the subject. T he Minister will undoubtedly seek advice from the 
appropriate Central staffs; so the sponsor of the project s hould ensure that these staffs 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 5 
have the opportunity to see the submission and supporting appraisal in draft, and to 
resolve any
 points of difficulty. 
 
27. It is embarrassing to the Department when flaws in an appraisal are detected only after a submission has gone to Ministers. Likewise, it is embarrassing to Ministers 
when flaws are not found until after the Mini ster has gone public, say by approving the 
issue of a consultative document. Ministers are entitled to a better service from the 
Department. No submission should be put to Ministers until the sponsor is entirely 
confident that the submission and suppor ting appraisal will stand up to scrutiny. 
 
Scrutiny 
 28. Once an appraisal has been complet ed, both it and the recommendation for 
action arising from it must be independently scrutinised, in order to protect the position of 
the Budget Holder, and to ensur e that value for money is likely to be achieved. This 
scrutiny role is often filled by the Budget  Manager. Additional information on Budget 
Holder/Manager responsibilities can be found in JSP 462.  29. Scrutiny should not be limited to t he recommendation for action, but should 
encompass the requirement itsel f. Requirement scrutiny is desig ned to ensure that only 
fully justified requirements,  which demonstrably contribute to the organisation’s agreed 
outputs, are approved. A financial scrutiny is carried out to ensure that approved 
requirements are affordable, that they are regular and proper char ges to the Defence 
Budget, and that they represent value for money . Scrutiny should also consider the options 
rejected, and must be completed before the proposal passes up the approvals chain. 
 
Role of Defence Economics  
 30. Defence Economics is responsible for the formulation and dissemination of policy on Investment Appraisal and Evaluation throughout the Departm ent, and the Chief 
Economist represents MOD in di scussions with HM Treasury about interpretation of, and 
addition to, the Green Book.  31. Defence Economics endorseme nt of all IAs which are to go to Ministers, the 
Investment Approvals Committee (IAC), and its delegated Authority or  which will support 
submissions that will do so is required. De fence Economics will provide advice, assistance 
and Scrutiny for all Centrally Approved cases. Early engagement is recommended, and 
regular contact should be maintained with Defence Economics thr oughout the period up 
until the main decision point. Defence Economi cs also has a formal scr utiny role in the 
assessment of benefits presented in cases submitted to the IAC. 
 32. Defence Economics’ advice and assi stance may be sought on any other 
appraisal though requests should normally be r outed through the relevant TLB focal point. 
Defence Economics will review a sample of such appraisals for DG Finance’s Annual 
Health of Financial Systems report.  
TLB Appraisal and Evaluation Teams 
 33. Appraisal and evaluation te ams, within each TLB, act as a focal point for advice 
and expertise on these subjects and Scrutiny, where they fall within the TLB’s delegated 
authority. Staff should seek gui dance from these team s in the first instan ce, and at an early 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 6 
stage. P
roposals involving potentially novel or  contentious expenditure  must be brought to 
their attention as soon as possible. 
 34. SFOs and Agency Chief Executives are responsible to DG Finance for the 
coverage and quality of in vestment appraisal throughout their areas of responsibility. They 
should make arrangements for m onitoring, and should make sure that they are made 
aware of any decision which runs counter to the conclusions of an investment appraisal, 
and any case where significant expenditure is committed without appraisal. They are 
required to cover investment appraisals and evaluations in thei r annual reports to DG 
Finance on the Health of the Fi nancial Systems in their areas. 
 
What is Evaluation? 
 35. Evaluation is the retros pective analysis of how well a project, progra mme, or policy 
is delivering against its performa nce, time and cost parameters. 
 36. When decisions have been taken and implemented, it is  then important to monitor 
and evaluate th e outcome. Only in this way can we hope to learn fr om our experience, avoid 
mistakes, and improve the quality of  future manageme nt decisions. 
 
What is the Purpo se of Evaluation? 
 37. A fundamental requirement of HM Treasu ry delegation is that  spending proposals 
are subject to effective appr aisal and evaluation. Effectiv e evaluation reinforces the 
accountability of Budget Holders for the resource s under their control.   
 38. The main purpose of evaluation is to en sure that good practice is perpetuated, 
lessons are learned, and the Depa rtment avoids repeati ng costly mistakes. It is not a tool for 
apportioning blame, but a vital source of informat ion for management de cision making. It 
should also lead to improved pr oject control and gove rnance, and is essent ial to be able to 
gauge the level of optimism bui lt into projec t estimates. 
 39. Evaluation is sometimes seen as a burdensome chore, tying up scarce resources for no immediate benefit. However, by analysing what went right and what went wrong on a project, and why, future performance can be improved and more value 
obtained from the defence budget. Evaluation should not be vi ewed as a post-mortem, but 
rather as a means of learning from experience.  
 
What to Address in  an Evaluation 
 40. An evaluation should address three distinct an d interlinked elements: 
 
a. Technical requi rements and operat ional capability 
b. Financial and commercial control c. Project governance and control 
 41. The evaluation should assess what went well and why, and what didn’t go well and 
why within all three elements.  A good evaluation distingu ishes between what has happened 
as a result of active man agement of the project, and what has happened because of 
unforeseeable external fact ors. The temptation to attribute, unfairly, successes to the former, 
and failures or problems to th e latter should be avoided, if  the evaluation is conducted 
objectively. A suggested te mplate for evaluation is  provided at Annex to  Part 2, chapter 2. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 7 
 
When to Undertak e an Evaluation 
 
42. Every project, programme, or policy requiring an appra isal should be evaluated. 
The extent and depth of  evaluation should be  commensurate with the value, length and 
complexity of the project, programme or policy to ensure the efficient allocation of resources. 
 43. A straightforward, low va lue project may only require a short evaluation at the end 
of the project life. For larger, longer runni ng projects, programmes, and policies, greater 
depth of evaluation will be re quired. For these, an  evaluation should be undertaken after 
each major stage of the project li fecycle e.g. initiation, initial gate, main gate, contract award, 
in-service, and on disposal or termination. This shou ld be planned for at project initiation, 
given that on any projec t, resources are limited. 
 44. Performing regular review s at predetermined stages in th e project lifecycle, where 
the team considers performance against ex pectations and discus ses the reasons for 
differences, enables the timely i dentification of lessons that can be applied to the next stage 
of the project life cycle. Ev aluation should also be carrie d out at other major project 
milestones e.g. a project manager leaving, in  order to prevent a loss of valuable project 
knowledge.  45. Any project that stops or  experiences any i ssues not previously envisaged should 
conduct a detailed evaluation of  the issues, causes and rem edial actions, including the 
effectiveness of remedial actions.  
Who is Responsible for Undertaking Evaluations? 
 
46. Evaluation is a line management responsib ility, and thus the responsibility for 
evaluation rests with the m anagement area responsible for the project, programme or 
policy.  Evaluation should be carried out by exis ting resources, with ex ternal facilitation or 
support if required, and be an integr al part of the project process.  The majority of effort and 
activity should complement other project controls such as risk management, stakeholder involvement and communication.   47. If a project is sponsored in one m anagement area but executed in another, the 
two areas should agree on who is to undertake t he evaluation. However, since the ultimate 
objectives of the project are t hose of the sponsoring area, t he presumption should be that 
it is this area that carries out the evaluation. For example,  a procurement project should be 
evaluated by the Customer for the equipment, and an acco mmodation project by the 
Garrison Commander. The Senior Finance Officer (SFO) in a TLB is responsible to DG 
Finance for ensuring the robustness of systems to support evaluation, as is the Chief 
Executive in an Agency. As part of this responsibility, SFOs and Chief Executives should 
ensure that procedures are in place in their areas to manage the process of project 
evaluation.

Disseminating Lessons Learned 
 
48. One of the key reasons for undertaking evaluations is to le arn lessons for the 
future. Lessons learned should be captured  and disseminated across TLBs within the 
Department and with industry at va rious levels identified in the governance. Project staff 
should include plans for the conduct of an ev aluation in the original appraisal, rather than 
simply stating that an ev aluation will be carried out.  
 49. The distribution of the evaluation s hould be such that lessons learned are 
communicated to others likely to benefit. T he evaluations of projects, policies or 
programmes that were reviewed by Defence Economics prior to their approval should also be forwarded to Defence Economics for co llation and analysis of key lessons. 
 
Appraisal and Evaluation within the Management Framework 
 
50. Both the appraisal and evaluation form part of a framework for management of 
policies and progra mmes called the ROAMEF  Framework (see Figure 1a ). ROAMEF  
stands for Rationale, Objectives, Appraisa l (of options), Monitoring, Evaluation and 
Feedback. Rationale  is the need for the policy or programme. The Objectives  flow from the 
need identified as being unmet, whilst Appraisal  is the assessment of the possible options 
to meet those needs. Monitoring  is the continuous review of  the project operation, and 
evaluation  is the assessment of the full effect s of the project against a previously 
determined baseline. Feedback  is communicating the results of evaluation to those 
concerned with the original proj ect or with related projects . HM Treasury recommend this 
framework is applied by a ll Government Departments.

2 The Elements of Business Cases and 
Appraisals 
 
A business case must be prepar ed for all proposals that would involve the commitment of 
resources or which would result in measurable benefits. The bu siness case must include five 
key elements: 
 
 a. The Strategic Case; 
 b. The Economic Case; 
 c. The Commercial Case; 
 d. The Financial Case; 
 e. The Management Case. 
 
An investment appraisal addre sses the Economic Case. A well-conducted investment 
appraisal should include the foll owing elements in sequence, ad dressing key issues relevant 
to each. These are: 
 
 a. the options being considered and the reasons for their selection; 
 b. short-listing of the options; 
 c. the costs and benefits of the various options; 
 d. assessment of risks; 
 e. sensitivity analysis; 
 f. other factors leading to the choice of a recommended option. 
 
 
What Is A Business Case? 
 1. The Business Case is a m anagement tool and is developed over time as a living 
document as the proposal deve lops. The Business Case keeps together and summarises the 
results of the analysis needed to support decision ma king in a transparent way. In its final 
form it becomes the key document of record fo r the proposal, also su mmarising objectives, 
the key features of implementation man agement and arrangements for post implementation 
evaluation.  2. Business cases can cover a wide range of types and levels of project, programme, or policy. The effort expended on developing the proposal s hould be proportionate to the 
likely costs and benefits. 
 
Business Case Structure 
 3. Business cases should contain the five elements defined by HM Treasury’s best 
practice ‘Five-Case’ Model. These are: 
 
a. The Strategic Case.  This will set out why the propos al is needed, the background 
to the proposal, the requirement, any ove r-riding and binding co nstraints, and any 
dependencies. 
b. The Economic Case. This considers the options for delivery and the assessment 
of Value for Money (VfM) (s ee Chapter 1, paragraph 7). 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 10 
c.
 The Commercial Case.  This sets out the procurement strategy and considers the 
commercial viability of the proposal. 
d. The Financial Case.  This establishes the affor dability and finan cing of the 
proposal. 
e. The Management Case.  This sets out how the pr oposal will be delivered in 
project and programme managem ent terms, and t he plans for evaluation of the 
proposal. 
 
4. All of these aspects  are important ; however, their size will vary from proposal to 
proposal depending upon  its nature and complexity. Some less complex business cases 
particularly those not involv ing significant new procuremen t, new systems or new building 
construction may need little or  nothing by way of a commer cial case and require a less 
complex management case.  5. Business Case Templates for proposal s that will be approv ed within TLB or 
Project Team delegation are available from  Individual TLB Appr oval Teams. Cases 
seeking central approval must co nsult the Approvals Guidance.  
 
The Development of the Business Case 
 6.
 The Business Case should devel op iteratively over time, often in two distinct stages 
with more detail being pr ovided at each stage.  
 
Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC) 
 
7. The Initial Gate business case see ks approval to undertake an assessment of 
the options (the Assessment Ph ase), within a defined Perform ance, Cost and Time (PCT) 
envelope, in order to determine which can best m eet the requirement i.e.  to reach, support 
and achieve a main investment decision at Ma in Gate. It includes an assessment of the 
risks and benefits of options for presentation at Main Gate. I ssues should not, except in 
exceptional circumstances, be addressed in terms  of a particular solution. The aim is to 
keep the options open, with specific reco mmendations being more appropriate to Main 
Gate approval.  8. An Initial Gate approval is normally required before formally  engaging the private 
sector (e.g. by advertising the requirement in  the MOD Contracts Bull etin and the Official 
Journal of the European Union). Exceptionally, the Initial Ga te may be omitte d for lower value 
and low risk cases with the agreement of  the relevant Appr oving Authorities. 
 9. The key elements of the IGBC are:  
a. The Strategic Case – outline the capab ility gap and the requirement to make a 
robust case for change. Determine benef its, risks, constraints, and 
dependencies; 
b. The Economic Case – set out the long-li st of alternative opt ions, and an initially 
recommended shortlist for further examination. Indicative costs and benefits for short-listed options should be provided; 
c. The Commercial Case – set out a proc urement strategy for the Assessment 
Phase (or equivalent); 
d. The Financial Case – discuss the likely affordability of the proposal, 
e. The Management Case –outline how the project will be set up and managed. 
Set out an exit strategy. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 11 
Main Gate Business Case (MGBC)  
 
10. 
The purpose of the MGBC is to revisit the IGBC in more detai l and to identify a 
preferred option which demonstr ably optimises VfM. It also sets out the likely deal; 
demonstrates its affordability; and details the supporting Pr ocurement Strategy, together 
with management arrangements for the successful ro llout of the proposal. 
 11. Main Gate constitutes the main investment decision where the Department commits to the full cost of the programme. This is usually taken to be the point at which a 
Preferred Bidder (PB) is selected. By this stage, the risks remaining in the project should 
be well understood and there should be sufficient c onfidence to take a Main Gate decision.  
 12. The key elements of the MGBC are:  
a. The Strategic Case – revisi ted and revised if required. 
b. The Economic Case – the value for m oney position is clear, supported by an 
endorsed investment appraisal complet ed in accordance with JSP 507, or a 
should-cost model for single-source cases; 
c. The Commercial Case – the procurement strategy is clear and indicates whether 
there will be any further decision points post Main Gate; 
d. The Financial Case – affordability and funding issues resolved; e. The Management Case – the detailed plans for delivery and arrangements for 
the realisation of benefits, management of risk; and post evaluation are recorded. 
 
The Strategic Case 
 13. The strategic case sets out the case for the proposal. It should set out the background to the proposal and the objective to be achieved. The fit with the wider public 
policy objectives and the department’s corpor ate plan should also be explained. Any 
constraints to competition should be explained, and any interaction with or dependency on any other proposals, e.g. the fi t with published targets such as  Public Service Agreements. 
Lessons learned from previ ous experience in this area should be briefly set out. 
 
Background 
 
14. The background to the project, programme, or policy should be explained in sufficient depth so that the reader can unde rstand why the need has arisen, and why the 
requirement (which should be stated explicitly) has been defined as it has. Material that is 
merely of historical in terest should be excluded. 
 
Requirement 
 15. It is necessary to establish how individ ual projects are linked to delivering final 
Defence outputs. Procuring an asset or service, or putting in place a scheme is not an 
appropriate requirement in itself. The requirement should ge nerally be predi cated on the 
need to, for example:  
a. provide further economies in the provision of an existing service; 
b. improve business effectiveness and se rvice quality in te rms of the required 
outcomes; 
c. improve efficiencies in the throughput of services; 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 12 
d. meet 
statut ory requirements and obligations; 
e. meet policy changes; 
f. deliver new business an d operational  targets. 
 16. The requirement must be clearly set out so that its achievem ent can be monitored. 
Clarity in the setting of the requ irement allows for scrutiny, and also assists in identifying the 
full range of opti ons which may be available to deliver the proposal.  
 17. The requirement should be expressed clearly and concisely in terms of the 
outcomes, effect, or service to be delivered.  It must not be expressed in a way that 
anticipates or pre-empt s a particular solution. 
 18. A clear statement of requirement is  necessary fo r three main reasons: 
 
a. Generating options. Clearly defined objectives make the process of generating 
options much easier. Requirements should reflect only the absolute essentials. 
Options can be assessed against the objec tives to see if they are worthy of 
consideration. Ill- defined objectives are likely to lead to unnecessary work; time 
spent considering unsuitable options is time wasted. However, objectives should not be set so tightly that they exclude otherwise worthwhile options and lead to 
costly re-workings at a later date. Care must be taken to ensure that options are 
not solution specific, nor should options  be excluded solely on the grounds of 
affordability in an existing budget.  
 
b. Selecting the Preferred Option. The selection of the prefe rred option involves an 
assessment of all the costs of delivering outputs. With  clear object ives and an 
indication of thei r relative importance, it  will be easier to identi fy and quantify all the 
costs and benefi ts involved.  
 
c. Evaluation. Evaluation is the process of meas uring the project outcomes against 
those forecast in the investment appr aisal or against some other agreed 
baseline. The absence of detailed objecti ves makes this task difficult, if not 
impossible.  
 19. In the equipment environm ent a capability audit would be used to establish the 
Single Statement of  User Need (SSUN). This sets the scope for the User
 Requirement 
Document (URD) in which more  detailed and individual r equirements and constraints are 
set out. More information can be found on the AOF (aof.mod.uk).  
 
Constraints 
 
20. Open and fair competiti on is a fundamental component of MOD acquisition policy 
in delivering affordable defenc e capability at over all long term VfM, and is a legal 
requirement in many circumstances. Compet itive procurement hel ps to deliver VfM 
because it gives suppliers an incentive to reduce costs, increase productivity and encourage innovation by conti nually benchmarking them agai nst their competitors. 
 21. The ability to run a competitive procurement may be affected by defence 
strategic considerations and ma rket constraints. Project team s should identify whether any 
constraints apply, and where they do, seek early engagem ent with Defence Economics or 
the relevant TLB Appraisal team, particularly w here the existence of c onstraints potentially 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 13 
results in only one option bei ng available to meet the r equirement (see Chapter 3,
 
paragraph 28. 
 
Dependencies 
 
22. Any actions or developm ents required of others should be considered if the 
ultimate success of the project, progr amme, or policy is dependent upon them.  
 
The Economic Case 
 23. This is the essential core  of the business case and se ts out the demonstration of 
value for money. This secti on of the business case assess es the economic costs and 
benefits of the proposal  to society as a whole, and span s the entire period covered by the 
proposal.   
Options 
 
24. Options should be generated with reference to the re quirement. As wide a range of 
options as possible should be considered in the early stage s to reduce the likelihood of 
expensive and time consuming revisiting at a later date. Involving all those who have a 
legitimate interest in the outcome of the decision may help in this respect. 
 25. The options considered in the appraisa l should be clearly and simply described, 
and the reasons for their selection should be fully explained. The list of options must 
include an option that will act as the baseline for determining value for money. Depending 
on the circumstances of the case, this may be either: 
a. ‘Do nothing’  i.e. where it is feasible to cease an activity; or 
b. The ‘status quo’ , i.e. continuing the existing serv ice at the same level and in the 
same way; or  
c. ‘Do minimum’ , i.e. doing the leas t that has to be done to comply with the 
requirement (for example meeting mini mum Health and Safety standards).  
 Consideration of the potential for private sector involvement in delivering the requirement should also be considered at this stage (s ee Chapter 3, and Part  2, Chapter 8). 
 26. Those involved in generating options s hould be imaginative, not always opting for 
the obvious solutions. For ex ample, if appraising a collocation project, sites other
 than those 
currently occupied shou ld be considered. (Early contact should be made with the Defence 
Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) (Estate Ratio nalisation) team, who will be able to advise on 
the availability of Defence site s to meet specific requirements. ) The availability of comparable 
facilities in other Commands and Services should be explored if the provision of new facilities 
is being contemplated. Options involving varying the scale or timing of a project should be 
explored as a means of potent ially increasing VfM, as shou ld all the individual elements. 
 27. Usually there will be a wide range of po ssible solutions to a specific problem. It 
will be rare for there to be only one possible option , and where this is the case, robust 
justification will be ne eded. You should consult your SFO, TLB Appraisal and Evaluation 
team, or Defence Economics, in such cases. Where there is genuinely only one possible 
option available to meet the identified objectives, a costed investment appraisal is not  
required  (see Chapter 3). However, it is still im portant to establish value for money, and 
the affordability of that option. 
 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 14 
Examples of options for a collocation project: 
a. Refurbish existing facilities; 
b. Maintenance by the private sector; 
c. Options to rent, build or purchase; 
d. Varying locations or sites; 
e. Provision of the service or facility by the private sector; 
f. Co-location with other agencies  
 
 
Short-listing the Options 
 
28. It is sensible to appraise in full (i.e. ex plicitly work through all the steps described 
in this guide) only those options that are c onsidered feasible. Howe ver, the reasons for 
rejecting options without appraising them fu lly should always be made explicit. Reasons 
for exclusion might for example be obvious ly poor VfM or unacceptable or unmanageable 
risks. Potentially viable best VfM solutions must not be e liminated at this stage.  
 29. The short-list must:  
a. Include the ‘do nothing’, ‘status quo’, or ‘do minimum’ option, which provides the 
benchmark for assessing value for money; and, 
 
b. Transparently record the reasoning and evidence behind the rejection of each 
excluded option. 
 30. The shortlist must not:  
a. Rule out options because they are “radical”, or becaus e their appraisal will be 
difficult, given the uncertainties that r equire resolution, or because they involve 
confronting vested interests; 
 
b. Reject options only because they have fewer benefits than some other more
 
costly option; 
 
c. Prematurely discard options; or, 
 
d. Reject options on grounds of affordab ility, without confirming the overriding 
nature of the budget restraint. 
 31. Options should not be disc arded without being appraised simply because they cost 
more than the budget provision in a specific ye ar, or for a particular item, because they may 
nevertheless be better value for money in the longer run than ‘a ffordable’ options . In principle, 
funding can be increas ed by re-allocating fund s. Ultimately, a judgement may be made that 
funding constraints ar e such that a second best option must be a dopted. But unless the 
‘unaffordable’ option  is included in th e appraisal, it will never be possible to make  an informed 
judgement on the best  way ahead. It is es sential that the ap praisal provides an  audit trail that 
demonstrates that the full r ange of options has been consider ed; so options should not be 
ruled out at an ea rly stage on affordability grounds. 
 32. If it will be diffic ult to reverse any decision, it may be partic ularly important to 
consider deferral or implementation in a more flexible manner. All shor t-listed options must 
be capable of financial and non-f inancial analysis. However, not all need be subjected to a 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 15 
full
 appraisal (for example, because of their obvious inferiority). Be st practice requires a 
presentation of a full range of op tions, if only in broad outline. 
 
Costs and Benefits  
 
33. Costs and benefits ( quantified and unquantifi ed) of each option should be set out 
clearly. To guard against error, and to ease t he scrutiny process, co sts and benefits should 
be presented on a ‘full co st’ basis rather than as differ ences from a baseline. Although 
decision-making is ultimately concerned with  the differences between the costs of the 
options, and the two methods ought  to give the same result, carrying out the costing on a 
‘differential’ basis has the following disadvantages:  
a. There is a risk of making mistakes, eit her omitting items or double counting them 
as costs in one option and benefits in another; 
 
b. Important information may be lost - a difference in staff costs of £100,000 per 
annum is much more significant if the total staff cost is £1m a year than if it is 
£10M; 
 
c. It becomes very difficult for someone scrutinising the apprai sal to understand the 
figures and to form a judgement on the soundness of the appraisal. 
 34. There is a judgement to make about t he amount of detail to include in the 
presentation. Investment apprai sals should include discounted ca sh flow tables in which 
the costs and benefits of each option are expressed in real terms (i.e. constant price levels 
excluding general inflation). T here should be sufficient detail for the key cost drivers to be 
identified, and to give the reader confidence that all cost el ements have been included, but 
not so much that important information is difficult to disentangle. The assumptions on 
which the costings have been based should be clearly documented, and  explanatory notes 
should give sources for all data.  35. It is not credible that future costs can be estimated to the nearest pound. Often estimates for major projects will only be accurate to the nearest £100,000 or £1M and 
should be rounded accordingly. Presenting more detail results in spurious accuracy and 
simply clutters the presentation. In smaller pr ojects it may be appropriate to round to the 
nearest £1,000. The results of sensitivity and scenario analyses should be included in 
presentations and summary repo rts, rather than just single point estimates of expected 
values. It is also important to check that spreadsheets, after redu ction and photocopying, 
can be read easily.  36. The level of effort to id entify and quantify costs and benefits for each option should 
be commensurate with the scale and complexity of the project. When identifying costs and 
benefits, consideration should be given to whether options might generate losses  or special 
payments.  
Optimism Bias and Risk 
 
37. In appraisals, there is always likely  t o  b e  s o m e  difference between what is 
expected, and what even tually happens. As a re sult an assessment of  the risks associated 
with each option must be made. At the early st ages of a project, programme, or policy, when 
risk management proposals are relatively und eveloped, an explicit allowance for optimism 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 16 
bi
as (see Part 2, chap ter 6) should be made against all options, regard less of the size or 
complexity of the proposal. 
 38. Optimism bias is the demonstrated, systematic, tendency for project appraisers 
to be overly optimistic about key project paramet ers. Appraisers tend to  overstate benefits, 
and understate timings and costs, both capital and operational.  
 39. As the business case develops, a more detailed assessme nt of individual risks and 
risk management will be required for larger projects . In these cases an optimism bias 
assessment will then be used as  a ‘sanity check’ of the risk assessment. For small projects 
the risk premium may continue to be encompasse d by a general uplift to  offset and allow for 
undue optimism bias. As costs ar e firmed, the level of optimism bias will decrease (see Part 
2, Chapter 6).  
Sensitivity analysis 
 
40. All appraisals must cont ain a sensitivity analysis to  test the vulnerability of 
options to future uncertainties, such as changes to flying hours, equipment numbers, or 
Out of Service Date (OSD). The sensitiv ity analysis should be based on plausible 
variations to the assumptions made, perhaps  based on evaluation of  previous projects. 
The values at which key variables would ca use costs or benefit values to change enough 
to affect the choice of preferred option should be explored. For example, how much would the cost of procuring a new IT system have to rise to outweigh the expected cost-savings it 
will provide? (For further information see Part 2, chapter 6, paragraph 73).  
Other factors 
 
41. The BC should show that every effort has been made to quantif y all relevant costs 
and benefits. Sometimes there are genuinely unquanti fiable costs and be nefits associated 
with a proposal. Where this is  the case they should be clea rly explained along with the 
reasons why quantifica tion can not reasonabl y be made. Where they are relevant to the 
choice of option, al ternative methods may be used  to support option sele ction. It is important 
however that such analysis is tr ansparent and that it is not structured in  such a way as to 
produce a biased or predetermined result.  42. Any such factors considered relev ant to the decision should be agreed with 
Defence Economics or the relevant TLB Appr aisal and Evaluation team (see Part 2, 
chapter 5 for further details).  
Whole Economy Impacts 
 
43. MOD investment appraisals  are concerned with appraising public value; that is 
the value to UK society of a proposal or option rather than just to the Exchequer or the Department. Wider social costs and benefits should only be included in an investment 
appraisal where:  
a. They can be reliably estimated on a sound empirical basis; b. Where they are material to the proposal; and c. Where it is proportionate to do so bearing in mind t he costs, benefits and risks of 
the proposal and the time and resources available. 
 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 17 
44. 
In practice, wider economy impacts ar e not included in investment appraisals, 
even when the choice is betw een domestic and overseas options (see Part 2, Chapter 5, 
paragraph 27). 
 
Recommendation 
 
45. The recommended solution should be supported by a tr ansparent and logical 
argument showing clearly why it  has been chosen, and how the various factors (the costs 
and benefits covered by the appraisal, the risks and uncertainties involved, other 
business/operational factors, security, wider policy issues and affordability) have affected 
the choice.  
Writing up the Appraisal 
 
46. For small projects the presentation of the appraisal results covering these 
elements can be incorporated in to the business case. However, for larger projects, 
particularly those covered by the Approvals Guidance, separate Inve stment Appraisal and 
Business Case documents should be produced.  When preparing separate Investment 
Appraisal and Business Case doc uments, it is not necessary to duplicate information 
required in the Business Case within the Investment Appraisal.    
The Commercial Case 
 47. The commercial case is co ncerned with issues of comm ercial feasibility and sets 
out to answer the question “can  the proposed solution be ef fectively delivered through a 
workable commercial deal or deal s?” The first question , therefore, is w hat procurement does 
the proposal require, is it cr ucial to delivery and what is  the procurement strategy? 
 48. The procurem ent strategy should be clearly set out in the commercial case and the 
ownership of any as sets should be clearly defined and key contractua l issues iden tified and 
explained, together  with the prop osed solution. 
 49. The allocation of risk mu st be clearly explained and the business case should 
include a risk table showing risk  allocation and the steps whic h are being taken to mitigate 
risk. Any personnel implications also need to be fully explained and if TUPE is involved this 
has to be properly included in th e delivery plans (see Part 2, chapter 4). (TUPE refers to the 
Transfer of Undertak ings (Protection of Employ ment) Regulations 2006). 
 50. The commercial case should show key contractual milestones  and delivery dates 
and should clearly set out the agreed accounting treatment. Detailed guidance can be found 
in the Acquisition Operating Fram ework (AOF) Commercial Toolkit. 
http://www.aof.dii.r.mil .uk/aofcontent/tactica l/toolkit/index.htm 
 
The Financial Case 
 
51. The financial case is concerned with issues of affo rdability, and sour ces of budget 
funding. It covers the lifespan  of the scheme and all attrib utable costs. The case needs to 
demonstrate that funding has been  secured and that it falls within appropriate spending and 
settlement limits. The focus in this sect ion of the case is on  capital and resource 
requirements (near-cash or non- cash) and so here VA T and capital charges are included. 
The financial case is concerne d with the budge tary impact. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 18 
52. Issues 
in addition to th e proposal’s affordability are: 
 
a. does the financial case ident ify and fill any funding gaps, 
b. does it contain provisi on for dealing with the financ ing of any time or cost 
overruns, 
c. does it fully explain and estimate any c ontingent liabilities t hat may result from 
the proposal? 
 
The Management Case 
 
53. The management case is concerned with the del iverability of the proposal and is 
sometimes referred to as programme man agement or project management case. The 
management case must  clearly set out man agement responsibilities, governance and 
reporting arrangements, if it do es not then the business case is  not yet complete. The Senior 
Responsible Owner should be identified.  54. The management case should include a de livery plan with clea r milestones which 
relate to but are at a more detailed level than contractual mi lestones. The management plan 
applies to any prog ramme or projects requi red by the proposal. Pr ogramme and project plans 
must include business assurance arrangemen ts. Where so-called co ntrolled environments 
such as information and comm unications technology are involved or complex business 
systems then the use of PR INCE2 methodology is mandatory for prog ramme and project 
management. Where significant change management is involved, a c hange management 
and stakeholder management plan should be included. 
 55. The management plan s hould also set out clearly any OGC Gateway Review 
arrangements, and should cont ain a benefit realisation plan  and benefit register. The 
management plan should also include a contract management plan and arrangements where 
contracts are required. There should be a contingency plan  with arrangements and plans for 
risk management and a risk register. 
 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
56. All business cases should include a pl an for monitoring their effects and a plan 
for subsequent evaluation. This should be more  than an assertion that  an evaluation will 
be carried out: it should show how the success or failure of the project will be measured; 
what data will be needed to support that measurement; and how that data will be collected; and when and by whom this is to be undertaken. These should include provision in both 
economic and financial cases for the associated monitoring and post implementation evaluation costs. This monitoring and feedback provision is essential to the longer term 
evolution of evidence based policy and without it the business case is not complete.

Annex A:  Business Case Checklist 
 
The following checklist highlights some of t he key points that should be considered when 
preparing a business case.  
The Strategic Case 
 
Justify the requirement 
 What has generated the n eed for this expenditure? 
 What capability gap has been i dentified? 
 Express the requirement clear ly and concisely – without a full understanding of the 
requirement, it is difficult to identify all the possible methods of addressing and 
meeting the need. 
 What are the key object ives of the proposal? 
 What outputs are required? When? 
 Do not pre-empt the solution – ensure the requirement is expressed in ou tput related 
terms that do not unnece ssarily restrict the num ber of possible options. 
 Decisions should not be taken prior to the completion of the IA. 
 Are constraints and dependenc ies identified  and managed? 
 
The Economic Case 
 Develop possible options  
 Need to consider all possible op tions for achieving the objectives. 
 Always include do nothing / status quo / do minimum options. 
 Options should not be co nstrained by affordability. 
 When considering opt ions for private se ctor delivery a valu e for money benchmark 
must be developed. 
 There should be no presumpt ion either in favour or agai nst in-house versus private 
sector provision. 
 Short-list the options 
 No option should be re jected without properly supported explanations. 
 Acceptable reasons for rejectio n include similar but inferior  to another option, or not 
feasible. 
 Not acceptable include discar ding on grounds of af fordability or not fully meeting user 
requirement. 
 All assumptions should be supported. 
 Time horizon 
 A realistic timescale should be chosen dependi ng on the nature and life of the project, 
e.g. life of the major fixed asset or period over which the service is required. 
 Could involve replacement of  assets in some options, e.g. computer systems. 
 
Identify and quantify costs and benefits  
 Costs and benefits shou ld cover the whole life of the pr oject and consider all impacts 
of the project regardless of budget area. 
 Ignore sunk costs. 
 Ensure costs and benefits are expressed in “real terms” (see Part 2, chapter 1). 
 Firm price contract costs should be  deflated prior to discounting. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 20 
 Include opportunity costs, running costs and savings / receipts as appropriate. 
 Include residual values where appropriate. 
 “Contingencies”, “premia”, “run ning costs” or ot her generic headings should always be 
supported and explained. 
 Use a 3.5% Discount Rate to  calculate Net Present Va lue (NPV). (For project 
durations exceeding 30  years refer to Part 2, chap ter 1, paragraphs 15 - 18). 
 Include allowance for relative price inflation as appropriate. 
 Exclude interest on capi tal, depreciation, VAT and general inflation. 
 Ensure data and assumptions are recorded and agreed by stakeholders. 
 Common costs should id eally be includ ed (see Part 1, chap ter 1, paragraph 43). 
 
Risk Assessment  
 In larger projects, ke y risks should be assess ed, evaluated and if possible, quantified, 
with particular emphasis on  how it is inte nded to mitigate or manage them. 
 An optimism bias assessment should be undertaken on all option s, where appropriate. 
 Is there a risk al location table? 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
 Sensitivity analysis of key variables should be u ndertaken in all cases. 
 Plausible variations to assump tions should be app lied to test the impact on the ranking 
of options. 
 Non-quantifiable factors 
 Are there any costs and benefi ts relevant to individual options that have not been 
quantified in the appraisal? 
 Recommendation 
 Of the options considered which represents best value for money for the 
Department? 
 If this is not the recommended r oute, state the justification 
Working papers 
 Should be clear and retained  for audit purpose. They will also potentially assist in 
any Project Evaluation. 
Defence Economics Consultation 
 Defence Economics must be consulted on  appraisals that will eventually be 
presented to Ministers, t he Investment Approvals Committee, and its delegated 
Authorities or whic h will support submissions that will do so. Defence Economics 
will provide advice, assistance and scrut iny for all Centrally approved cases. 
The Commercial Case  
 Is the proposal commercially feasible / deliverable? 
 What procurement is required; goods, services, land, buildings? 
 What is the procurement strategy?  What are the key contractual issues? 
 There must be clear contractual key milestones and delivery dates 
 There must be clear agr eed accounting treatment 
 What if any are the personnel im plications and is  TUPE applicable? 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 21 
The Financial Case 
 Focus on affordability; is full budget f unding secured and budgeted by all parties? 
 What are the impacts on income/e xpenditure a/c and on balance sheet if 
applicable? 
 Are potential cost over runs provided for 
 Are there any cont ingent liabilities? 
 Any guarantees? 
The Management Case 
 Is the proposal practically deliver able and what are the delivery plans? 
 Are there clear delivery dates and detailed milestones?  Does the proposal require progra mme or project management techniques? 
 Is there a contract management plan?  Change management require s a change management plan! 
 If in a controlled environment such as ICT use of PRINCE 2 is mandatory!  Does the plan include clear arrangem ents for OGC Gateway peer reviews? 
 Is there a contingency plan with arr angements & provision for risk management? 
 There should be a benefit realisation table and plan. 
 
Evaluation plan  
 Does the plan include monitoring arrangements (who when how and costs)? 
 The Business Case shou ld include a plan for any subseq uent evaluation, i.e. what is 
to be evaluated, when will th ey be carried out, and by whom? (see Part 2, chapter 7)

3 Involving the Private Sector 
 
The extent of involvem ent of the private sector can vary  from minor elem ents of a proposal 
being contracted-out through to full privatisation, with vari ous forms of contracting, 
outsourcing, partnering and PFIs in between. 
 
Careful consideration needs to be given to wh ich procurement route is likely to be most 
effective. In some cases, the appropriate  balance between public and private sector 
provision will be clear. In ot hers, the best solution must be identified across a range of 
public, private and partnership options. The key obj ective is to ensure that taxpayers get 
value for money. 
  
Introduction 
 1. Private sector provision may be more lik ely to provide a better solution where the 
scope for the following is greatest:  
a. Innovation to reduce costs or to improve observable outcomes; 
b. Generating additional revenue flow s by sales to third parties; 
c. Reduction in risk of cost  overrun or benefit shortfall; 
d. A contractor is able to exploit economie s of scale in the provision of services 
(e.g. IT support or facilities maintenance); 
e. Savings in whole life costs and/ or for improved outcomes through effective 
design (e.g.: where a broad range of services may be provided in association with an asset, or when many inputs must be integrated in delivering a service, or 
where whole life and operating cost s are importantly determined by good 
design); 
f. Clear specification of qua lity standards in absolute terms  or in terms of client 
satisfaction; 
g. Ability of privat e sector to control discrete el ements of the project without 
excessive oversight or  interference; or, 
h. Clear boundaries and interfaces bet ween public and private sectors. 
 2. Provision by the private sect or may be less appropriate where: 
 
a. Risks which threaten the viability of a project are outside the control of the 
contractor (and these risks cannot be separ ated contractually from the project); 
b. The predominant risks are ones where the public sector has the comparative 
advantage in managing them; 
c. A large degree of discreti on is required in determining the quality of services, and 
quality is not observable; or, 
d. Bidding costs are large in proportion to the value of the project (although there 
may be means of reducing these costs). 
 
Risk transfer 
 3. When faced with significant risks, transferri ng part or all of it to  the private sector 
should be considered. The governi ng principle is that risk should be allocated to whichever 
party from the public or privat e sector is best placed to manage it. The optimal allocation of 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 23 
risk, rather than maximising risk
 transfer, is the objective, and is vital to ensuring that the 
best solution is found. Accordingly, the degree to which risk is transferred depends upon 
the specific proposal being appraised. 
 4. Successful negotiation of risk transfer requires a clear understanding by the procuring authority of the risks presented by a proposal, the broad impact that these risks 
may have on the suppliers’ incentives and financ ing costs, and the limits to risk transfer 
which might still be considered for value for money.  5. Where the private sector has clear ownership, responsibil ity and control, it should 
be encouraged to take and mitigate all of thos e risks it can manage more effectively than 
the procuring authority. If t he procuring authority seeks to reserve many of the 
responsibilities and controls that go hand-in-hand with service delivery and yet still seek to 
transfer significant risk, ther e is a danger that t he private sector will increase its prices. 
 6. A risk allocation table can be a useful tool to identi fy the bearer of each risk 
relevant to a proposal. An exam ple of this is set out below: 
 
Risk Allocation Table  
Risk Scale Bearer Key Issues

Obsolescence Low  √ Assets require low levels 
of technology

 Med √  … 
Design risk 
 High  √ … 
Residual Value Low √  … 
3rd party 
revenues Low  √ … 
Regulatory 
change  High √  … 
Etc … … … … 
 
Competition Policy 
 7. Open and fair competiti on is a fundamental component of MOD acquisition policy 
in delivering affordable defence capability at overall long term Value for Money (VfM), and 
is a legal requirement in m any circumstances. Competitive procurement helps to deliver 
VfM because it gives suppliers an incentive to reduce costs, increase productivity and 
encourage innovation by continually benchma rking them against their competitors. 
Competitive procurement is MO D’s default procurement route. 
 
Legal Obligations 
 
8. The following Procurement Law applies: 
 
a. MOD is required by the Public Cont racts Regulations 2006 (also known as the 
Procurement Regulations) to advertise and to run a compet itive procurement 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 24 
process for contracts for goods, works or s
ervices except where exempt under 
Article 346 of the Treaty for the Func tioning of the European Union.   
b. MOD procurement is also subject to  EU Treaty principles, including equal 
treatment, transparency and non-discriminat ion that should apply to all MOD 
procurements that fall within the scope of the Treaty even where the 
Procurement Regulations do not apply.  
 
Non-legally binding obligations 
 
9. Teams should continue to adhere to the European Defence Agency’s Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement to contract for goods and services that benefit from the Article 346 exemption and are above the threshold of Euro 1 million.  
 
The benefits of competition 
 
10. Competitive procurement  delivers benefits by tackling two basic problems. 
Firstly; there is an asymmetry of informati on between MOD and its s uppliers in that the 
latter are far better informed about the likely co st of providing a par ticular capability, yet 
have an incentive to overstate these costs to the customer in order to increase their profits. 
Secondly, once a contract has been signed suppl iers may have an incentive to act in ways 
which benefit their interests at  the expense of the customer. 
 11. Competition partly resolves these issues by providing a benchmarking function in that it allows the MOD to compare prices acro ss a range of supplie rs, giving it more 
information. Firms competing for the contract have an incentive to bid as low as possible 
(whilst still earning an acceptable amount of prof it) in order to maximise their chances of 
winning. This will tend to force firms’ bids down closer to their true costs of production 
making them a better indi cator of their costs. 
 12. After a contract has been signed, competit ion exerts pressure through a different 
mechanism. If a supplier knows that the MOD has a range of potential alternative 
providers, the incentives for them to  engage in behaviour which might lead to 
unsatisfactory performance and hence risk them  losing future business, are reduced.  
 
Limitations of competition 
 
13. The key limitation on the use of compet ition in defence procurement is the small 
number of potential suppliers, with  most areas of the market ha ving only a handful of firms 
capable of acting at the prime contractor level. This is exacerbated by significant barriers 
to entry in the form of the large up-front c apital investments and the required technological 
expertise. These make it difficult for new firms to ‘break into’ the market, making the 
consequences of a firm exiting the market on  the level of competition more severe. 
 14. A consequence of this is that MOD proc urement decisions can have a significant 
impact on the structure of the market.  As a re sult of losing a partic ular competition a firm 
may no longer have sufficient orders to sustain its industrial capacity.  The nature of the 
competitive process means that  unless they can somehow sustain this capacity the firm 
will slowly be driven out of the market by their rivals, r educing the level of  competition in 
the long run.  15. This can lead to ‘winner takes all’ ty pe competitions in which firms have a strong 
incentive to submit overly optim istic bids in order to win the contract, with the expectation 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 25 
that when problems emerge in t he future they will be able to renegotiate t
erms because 
the MOD is already locked into the contract  and / or there are no credible alternative 
suppliers left in the market. 
 16. More broadly, the adversarial nature  of competition discourages defence firms 
from being completely open with the MOD for f ear that information might leak to their 
competitors, giving them a commercial advant age. Where a project contains significant 
technological or programme risks this reduced openness may result in problems not being identified and dealt with early, leading to shortfalls in performance on time / cost / 
effectiveness.  
Constraints on Competitive Procurement 
 
17.  The ability to run an open and fair com petitive procurement may be affected by 
defence strategic considerations and market c onstraints. Project teams should identify 
whether any constraints apply,  and where they do, seek early engagement with Defence 
Economics or the relevant TLB Appraisal and Evaluation team.  18. Project teams are likely to have to just ify any constraint due to defence strategic 
activities under a treaty exem ption or general exclusion fr om EU procurement law. If a 
project team has any doubt ab out the application of an exem ption or exclusion, they 
should seek legal advice from CLS-CL. If a treaty exemption or general  exclusion does not 
apply, project teams will have to justify any single source  procurement due to market 
constraints under Regulation 16 of  the Defence and Security Pu blic Contract Regulations 
(DSPCR) 2011 or Regulation 14 of Public  Contract Regulations 2006.   
 
19. As set out in the National Security Through Technology  White Paper, published 
in February 2012, the principle of Open Procurement is qualified by the principle of 
Technology Advantage. Technology advant age comprises two elements: freedom of 
action and operational advantage: 
 
a. Operational Advantage  (Op Adv) is the ability to  find and main tain an edge 
over potential adversaries, both to increase the chances of our success in hostile situations and to increase the protection of the UK assets involved, 
especially our people . Operational advantage can be  based on a number of 
factors such as superior intelligence, training and doctrine, but is particularly 
important in terms of equipment  and underpinning technologies;  
b. Freedom of Action (FoA) is the ability to determi ne our internal and external 
affairs and act in the country’s interests fr ee from intervention by  other states or 
entities, in accordance with our legal obligations. This freedom is the essence of 
national sovereignty. Different acquisition options offer differing levels of assurance in relation to our future fr eedom of action, particularly where a 
potential supplier is based overseas. 
 20. The White Paper notes t hat there may be occasions wh ere we decide to protect 
an aspect
 of capability for national security reasons. How we choose to protect that 
capability will always involve a ba lance of risk and innovative thinking about the most cost 
effective solution. We may, for instance, chose to consider working with Allies, share military capabilities, or entering into arrangements to ensure appropriate levels of 
technology sharing and security of supply.  There may also be competition law and 
procurement law implications to consider.   
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 26 
21. 
Where we judge that it is essential to take action to protect the UK’s operational 
advantage or freedom of action, we expect to seek to protect up to four aspects of a 
specific capability by obtaining specific security of supply1 undertakings. These four 
aspects are timely access to the: 
 
a. essential skills and knowledge needed to des ign, develop, integrate, evaluate, 
support and maintain key systems and s ub-systems, together with the conduct 
of test, evaluation, support and upgrade pr ocesses for those systems. Science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematic al (STEM) skills are likely to be 
particularly important here.  
b. facilities and infrastructure which s upport these processes including specialist 
manufacturing and production faci lities, design systems, support 
c. infrastructure, and test and integration rigs; d. technologies critical to the desi gn and development of key systems and 
subsystems; and 
e. appropriate freedoms from potential legal constraints on the use of technology 
(including intellectual property rights) to enable the UK and its suppliers to 
maintain, upgrade, and operate key systems and sub-systems. 
 The timescales within which access is needed will be established as part of setting the 
requirement and the delivery strategy for that capability.  22. Further guidance to assist dec ision makers is provided in:  
Policy Guidance – Criteria for Applying O perational Advantage and Freedom of Action in 
Defence Acquisition 
(http://www.aof.dii.r.mil.uk/aofcontent/downloads/security/20130603_Policy-guidance-FOA OA-U.doc) 
 23. In exceptional cases, w here it can be clearly demonstrat ed that it is appropriate 
to source an aspect of capab ility we need for our freedom of action or operational 
advantage only from within the United Kingdom , MoD will seek deliv ery from the UK 
industrial base. Competitive procurement may have to be limited to suppliers who have 
appropriate facilities and personnel in the UK or the contract may hav e to be structured so 
that it uses other protective measures such as firewalls between elements of the contract. 
An aspect of capability will be re garded as being ‘retai ned in the UK industrial base’ if the 
people possessing the skills and the facilities repr esenting that capability reside in the UK 
and the requisite Intellectual Property RIPR can be effectively utilised in the UK. Due 
regard needs to be given to the im pact of foreign control laws on the ability to effectively 
exercise the IPR and the impact this could ha ve on third party use of the IPR for MOD. 
 24. The scope for full and open competitive procurement may be further influenced 
by the following market factors:   
 
a. IPR. Access by MOD to sufficient rights to  enable a third party to utilise IPR on 
MoD’s behalf is fundamental to achievi ng competitive procurement for many MOD 
requirements from research and technology  right through the procurement cycle to 
disposal. Where there is a sole source  of supply because MOD does not possess 
any or sufficient IPR, or where the ri sk would be too great to place work with 
another party (for instance wh ere Airworthiness Certification would be jeopardised 
                                           
1 Security of Supply is the ability to guarantee and be guaranteed the supply of goods and services that are 
essential to military operations to prosecute t he Government’s foreign and security policies. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 27 
should wor
k be placed with a party other than the Design Author ity), then teams 
should consider whether there is any opport unity to reformulate the requirement or 
obtain licensing to open up co mpetitive procurement.  
 
b. Single Source Worldwide . In some circumstances t here may only be a single 
source of supply worldwide. If there is a single source of supply worldwide, teams 
should consider whether there is an y opportunity to promote competitive 
procurement for example reformulating the requirement or stimulating the market. A 
detailed cost/benefit and risk analysis should be undertaken to ensure that such an approach would deliver  long term VfM. 
 
c. Limited Market Opportunities . There may be a lack of suppliers with the required 
capacity to deliver the requirement or a la ck of ‘real’ competitive pressure in the 
market. Where there are limited market  opportunities defence firms may find 
themselves in a position where a competitive procur ement becomes a ‘must win’ 
situation with failure to secure a contract likely to result in a particular industrial 
capability being run down due to lack of work and becoming unsustainable. Given 
the small number of firms c apable of acting at the prime contractor level such a 
situation could lead to an eros ion of MoD’s ability to com pete similar contracts in the 
future. Teams should consider  whether the likel y impact on long term VfM is large 
enough to justify the use of some other procurement approach, such as alliancing, to sustain the long term availability of e ssential industrial capability, subject to the 
usual value for money and affordability consi derations. However, it is important that 
MoD does not sustain companies that woul d otherwise be unviable entities due to 
the legal and presentational issues involved.   
 Increasing the Opportunities fo r Competitive Procurement 
 25.  Recognising the potential constraints im posed by strategic considerations and 
market structure, teams should look to use other opportuni ties to promote competitive 
pressure to ensure VfM is achieved.   26. The following should be considered when the procurement and commercial strategies are being developed:  
a. Review of the Defence St rategic Considerations. Where competitive procurement is 
constrained due to defence strategic cons iderations, teams should review the 
nature and scope of the constraints to es tablish which are overriding and to 
consider the potential for trade offs. 
 
b. Licensing of IPR. Where competitive procurement is  constrained due to the lack of 
rights to utilise requisite IPR, then teams should consider whether licensing IPR is a 
viable option to enable competitive procurement. 
 
c. Encouraging Competition in the Supply Network. Where it can be clearly 
demonstrated that security considerations and/or market struct ure prohibit the use 
of competitive procurement and a single  source is selected, competitive 
procurement to deliver VfM should be encouraged throughout the supply n
 etwork in 
line with the Codes of Best Practice 5 wher e this does not compromise UK national 
security and is both feasible and appropr iate. Project teams must be aware there 
are specific rules for Subcontracting under  the DSPCR 2011 to which they must 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 28 
adhere. The team should al so demonstrate how the benefits f
rom encouraged 
competition further down the supply network will feed through to the MoD. 
 
d. Reformulation of the Requirement. Teams should consider w hether the requirement 
could be reformulated or redefined to bri ng the competitive procurement process to 
bear. 
 
e. Stimulation of the Market. It should be assessed whet her the market could be 
stimulated to enable a competit ive procurement to be held. 
 
f. International Collaboration . International collaboration c an deliver better value to the 
customer through the sharing of overheads and the benefits of ec onomies of scale, 
encouraging the evolution of  the global defence technol ogical and industrial base. 
 
g.  Co-operation with Other Govern ment Departments (OGDs). 
 
h. Project teams should c onsider whether acting colle ctively with OGDs to meet 
competitive requirements will deliver  better VfM compared to separate 
Departmental action. 
 
i. Security of Supply.  Project teams must consider at the start of the procurement the 
importance of an assured supply,  in particular taking account of the criticality of the 
goods or services to Technol ogy Advantage.  The DSPCR allows procurers to take 
a number of non-discriminatory ac tions to protect Security of Supply. There are also 
a number of formal Security of Supply arrangements in place with other nations 
which can provide assurances to the UK in emergency situations. 
 
Assessment of Value for Money 
 
27. Project teams should identify whether any constraint s apply and, where they do, 
provide a full written explanat ion of their impact and the steps taken to maximise 
competitive procurement. Teams should not approach HM Treasury for consideration of their proposals until such work has been comple ted. All teams are required to provide 
evidence for the audit trail and obtain i ndependent assurance from Defence Economics or 
the relevant TLB Appraisal an d Evaluation team. An outline of evidence required is 
provided at Annex A.  
Single Option Cases 
 
28. Circumstances may arise in  which an identified requir ement can only be met by 
one option. An example of this  may be where there is a requirement for the purchase from 
the Original Equipment Manufacturer of spar es in support of a particular equipment. If 
there is no other supplier for t he spares it can be a straightforward choice between buying 
and not buying. The same may also be true when purchasing repair/servicing, Post Design 
Services (PDS) or, where In tellectual Property Rights, Contractual Terms, or Design 
Authority status applies. Other  examples could be where oper ational constraints limit the 
available options, or a long-term contract  with options to renew or extend.  
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 29 
29. 
Options must not be limited by time or  resource constraints due to poor planning 
or management decisions or by departmental strategies. Agreement must be sought 
from Defence Economics or the relevant TLB Appraisal & Evaluation team in all 
such cases, and this does not remove th e requirement to assess optimism bias, 
risk, and affordability . 
 
 
 Constraints to competition  (see 
paragraphs 3.1.18 – 4.1.21) 
Viable Options 
Consider how VFM will be demonstrated (e.g.):

Solutions: 
Shortlist Options,

All but one 
option ruled
 out 
by qualitative 
analysisNO YES REQUIREMENT
30. 
Where it has been assessed that only one viable option exists to meet a defined 
requirement, it will be necessary to determi ne that the cost of that option is not 
unreasonable. This will typically be achieved through the production of a ‘Should Cost’ 
model (see Part 2, Chapter 8,  paragraph 11), cost comparat or, or benchmark. A range of 
measures may be necessary to demonstrate va lue for money through life (see Part 2, 
chapter 8, paragraphs 41 - 51).  
Routine Re-provisioning Decisions 
 
31. Routine re-provisioning or renewal of  contracts do not require an investment 
appraisal or value for money assessment providing the following criteria apply: 
 
a. A requirement exists and has been established by an existing contract; 
b. Value for money has been satisfactorily delivered, evidenced by evaluation (see 
Part 2, chapter 7); 
c. There have been no changes in circumst ance from the original procurement. 
 
32. Evidence must be presented that  consideration has been given to: 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 30 
 
a. 
the remaining period the equipment is  expected to remain in service; 
b. the planned future utilisation of the main  equipment and how this differs from past 
experience; 
c. spares consumption or Mean Ti me Between Failure (MTBF) rates; 
d. current levels of free stock; 
e. stock return trends. 
 
33. Where there are any other significant factors to be considered, such as potential alternative suppliers or innovative support packages, an appraisal must be undertaken.  
Business Improvement Policy 
 
34. The overriding objective is to provide defence outputs offering best value for 
money affordable to the taxpayer. As part of t he process of ensuring a fair comparison can 
be made between the true costs and risks of under taking activities commercially and those 
of retaining activities in-house an investment appraisal must be produced.  
 35. In reviewing activities, there is a need to:  
a. set clear objectives; b. ensure that the scope is fully defined and robust; c. consider the full range of options to meet the r equirement including in-house 
options; 
d. undertake a fully detailed risk assessment; e.  achieve the best value for money outcome within available funding. 
 36. The scoping and feasibility stages of each review will determine the eventual 
means of securing improvement. In determi ning the appropriate scope, consideration 
should be given to the potential impact on MOD employees in side and outside the project 
boundary. Whatever the ev entual outcome, the review proce ss is likely to result in new 
ways of delivering services and TUs will need to be involved.  Management must keep the 
TUs fully informed and consult with them as appropriate and at the appr opriate level. The 
process must be as transparent as possible recognising commercial sensitivities, to 
ensure that Trade Unions and st aff understand how an objective decision will be reached. 
It should be borne in mind that MOD policy for inte raction with TU’s is clearly set out in the 
Employee Relations Policy locat ed in the People Services pa ges of the Defence Intranet 
and any failure to adhere to its direction is likely to delay, rather than expedite  the project.       
 37. TLBs or Trading Funds considering pr oposals for the external provision of 
services will need to address the full resource  implications of such projects. Potential 
projects must be given proper priority and be effectively managed. If the potential benefits 
from commercialisation appear to  be relatively small, and are li kely to be outweighed by 
the costs of competition or  the increased MOD management co sts, the work should be 
retained in-house.  38. Management must approach consultation wi th an open mind and seek to achieve 
agreement by creating a relationship with the Trade Unions based on mutual trust through 
openness, explanation and the exchange of views. Consultation is  likely to involve informal 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 31 
dialogue as well as the formal processes set out  in the Employee Relations Policy s
ection 
of People Services on the Defence Intranet. 
 39. An important part of t he scoping work will be the agreement of the requirement. 
This should reflect the capability required, expr essed in output terms. It will not necessarily 
equate to the scope of work that may be contra cted to industry. The requirement will form 
the basis for developing options for the deliv ery of the required c apability. In drawing up 
the requirement, management must  engage the Trade Unions an d the workforce as fully 
as possible at the earlie st practicable stage.  
 
Options  
 
40. Once the scope of the work has been identified and the r equirement has been 
agreed, the context of the revi ew will determine the nature of  the assessment. Where work 
is currently conducted in-house, TLBs  and Trading Funds will need to ask:   
 
a. Should some or all of the work be reta ined in-house, and if so how can efficiency 
improvements be made? 
b. Where it is judged that best value for money could be achieved by 
commercialisation of some or all of t he work currently conducted in-house, how 
should this be done? 
 41. Where work is currently provided under  contract with the private sector, the 
issues are likely to be: 
 
a. How is the existing contract performing? 
b. Does the opportunity exist for de-scoping i. e. bringing some or all of the work back 
in-house, perhaps as part of a wider  in-house efficiency initiative?  
c. Where contracts must be re-com peted, how best should this be done? 
 
Value for Money Benchmark  
 
42. Reviews of business activities will always need to establish the most cost-
effective option for delivering that activity. Part of this examination will need to be an 
assessment of whether any in-house proce sses currently in place can be improved. 
Whenever a project includes an option for delivery of the requirement through a 
commercial bid, an appropriate Value for Mo ney Benchmark (VfMB) must be developed. 
 
43. The purpose of the VfMB is to test t he value for money of commercial bids. It can 
take a number of different forms and may incorporate in-house provision, bought-in 
services, or a mixture of the two:  
a. In the majority of cases the VfMB wil l be an assessment of the cost of how MOD 
would deliver the defi ned output as the best alternative to commercial bids (i.e. a 
‘would cost’ model). It should not be constrai ned by affordability. The VfMB is likely 
to be based on existing methods of delivering the requirement, but should take into account all reasonably foreseeable efficiencies in delivering the defined output. Trade Unions should be consulted and invit ed to provide suggestions for possible 
efficiencies and new working practices. Every effort should be made to provide 
realistic and deliverable  cost estimates. However, it would not be usual to seek firm 
prices from industry to inform the VfMB. 
 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 32 
b. 
In larger or more complex cases, additi onal effort will be appropriate to establish an 
operationally achievable, fully deliverable , robust benchmark. Construction of a 
Fully-resourced VfMB  requires the establishment of a dedicated team and budget to 
provide the necessary resource to fully dev elop ‘do better’ or ‘do different’ options. 
A Fully-resourced VfMB can add value to the competition process as it offers a 
challenging, deliverable solution. However, significant costs will be incurred, and the 
Department needs to be confident in advanc e of incurring such cost there is a 
reasonable prospect of its recovery; i.e. t hat this option can deliver a value for 
money solution. 
 
c. A ‘Should cost’ model is an assessment of what a commercial solution to deliver the 
defined output should cost. This is appropriate where the activity is not currently provided, and could not be provided, in-hou se e.g. construction. The ‘should cost’ 
model is a theoretical construct of how the project team cons iders a commercial 
provider would deliver the requirement. The costs of each delivery element would 
be estimated from information gathered from existing sources (e.g. past contracts, 
CAAS pricing), and from relevant external  sources (e.g. market soundings, sector 
consultants). It is not an achievable solution,  but provides a target to inform contract 
negotiations with commercial bidders. 
 44. The appropriate form of VfMB to ado pt must be agreed with and endorsed by 
Defence Economics, or the rele vant TLB Appraisal and Evaluat ion team for projects within 
TLB thresholds. Trade Unions must be inform ed and consulted. Defence Economics is the 
final arbiter in the process.   
Risk 
 
45. To be a valid benchmark against which private sector bids can be compared 
fairly, the VfMB must reflect not only certai n procurement costs but  also the risk that 
additional costs may arise, which under industry proposals w ould fall to the supplier. 
During the procurement process, risks should be identified,  and ways in which these risks 
can be mitigated considered. It is necessary to assess the impact of these risks on costs, 
estimate their probabilities, and explore and appreciate the sens itivity of these estimates. 
In many cases, adjustments to the original cost estimates wil l be needed to arrive at the 
final risk adjusted VfMB. Comprehensive accounting for risk is required to ensure that valid 
and informed comparisons can be made amongst the bids and between the bids and the VfMB.   
In-House Efficiencies 
 
46. There will be circumstances  where the best course of  action for the Department 
may be to continue to deliver activities in -house but to improve the efficiency of the 
existing business process. Reasons may include; 
 
a. the activity is not suitable for comme rcial treatment (perhaps  because it is too 
specialised or because business processes are too inextricably linked with tasks, which for military reasons must be kept in-house),  
 
b. risk cannot be satisfactorily tr ansferred to the private sector.  
 The onus is on the Depar tment to pursue all possible means of improving the efficiency of 
activity delivery.  
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 33 
 
47. 
In examining the scope for more cost e ffective solutions, it is important that 
management and workforce alike should realise there should be no pr esumption that any 
previously successful In-House Bid (IHB) or VfMB should be mainta ined indefinitely. 
However, the Department is not required to compete work won previously by IHBs if, following rigorous investigation,  they believe that commercia lisation offers poor prospects 
of better value for money or the cost of conducting the tender ex ercise outweighs the 
benefits that might accrue from commercialis ation. This would need to be revisited 
periodically to test that it remains valid. In such cases, it will be up to management to 
engage the Trade Unions and the workforce in order  jointly to pursue all available means 
of improving and reducing the cost  of that activity in-house. 
 
48. The Department should examine the scope for efficiencies in undertaking 
activities in an innovative manner. For exampl e, they might consider the potential scope 
for "bundling" similar activities  to increase the potential for sy nergies or economies of scale 
to be realised. On the other hand, too lar ge a span in bundling can result in over 
complication and unnecessary overheads. TLBs or  Trading Funds will want to take into 
account experience elsewhere in the Department in decidin g which activities can be 
delivered and provide better value for money. It is for MOD as informed customer to 
decide how best to meet its requirements, but the Trade Unions must be consulted fully at 
all times. The aim must be to ensure t hat a comprehensive r ange of options are 
considered at the outset and the optimum solution shou ld be arrived at following 
assessment of all relevant factors such as their viability, economic appraisal and 
consistency with business plans.  
 
Tender Evaluation 
 
49. The Trade Unions must be invited to appoint an independent observer as part of 
the bid evaluation process, as  set out in the Employee Relations Policy located in the 
People Services pages on the Defence Intranet. 
 
Review of Existing Outsourced Contracts 
 
50. Where activities are already provided by  a commercial contractor, a review of all 
options should consider whether the services could be provided  more cost effectively in 
the future. At contract expiry, the contra ct will normally be re-let following competition 
amongst external providers. It might be possible to  undertake activities more effectively in-
house through imaginativ e and innovative approache s rather than continue to pursue the 
commercial solution. In such circumstances the existing commercial operation, together 
with much of its working practices and co rporate knowledge woul d be transferred in-
house. TLBs and Trading Funds will need to cl early demonstrate at the outset that the 
introduction of competitive in-house proposals offer even better value for money (for 
example by building on the experience of the commercial sector) when compared with 
existing commercial arrangements. In such ci rcumstances, a VfMB should be developed in 
consultation with the Trade Unions, and cons idered alongside other commercially-based 
options.    
Extending Life of Existing Outsourced Contracts 
 51. The negotiation of an extension to a contract beyond its or iginal performance, 
cost and time envelope will be the exception and not the rule  and will require a clear 
business case. Extending an existing contract will usually be a short- term measure, and 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 34 
must not be used to circumv ent a competition for re-let. Value for money must be
 
demonstrated and subjected to appropriate scrutiny in all such cases. Legal and 
Commercial Policy advice must be sought at  an early stage to ens ure that the MOD’s 
obligations under the EU Services Directive  and competition law are complied with and 
that the Department’s industria l and competition policy is fo llowed. Trade Unions must be 
informed and given the opportunity to be consulted.  
External Assistance 
 52. External Assistance can be summarised as the procurement from the private 
sector of consultancy assistance. Cases seeking to procure External Assistance must include all the elements of an ap praisal as set out in Part 1,  Chapter 2. In addition, the 
following specific points apply:  
a. Internal consultancy resources must be considered before External Assistance is 
engaged. Alternative options fo r meeting the specified requirement must therefore 
include the option of MOD internal res ources, even if that  would require re-
prioritisation of other tasks. 
b. Trade Unions must be cons ulted on all proposals to proc ure External Assistance, 
initially on an informal basis, which may le ad to a formal cons ultation period where 
TUs believe it necessary. 
c. Skills Transfer from the External Assistance prov ider to MOD staff is required 
unless it can be demonstrated not to be appropriate. The approach to ensure the 
transfer of skills must be set out. 
d. Cases must comply with DCP-EF-03- 08-01 dated 11 June 2010 ‘External 
Recruitment Freeze’. 
 53. Where there is a requirement to extend  an existing contract, an evaluation must 
be undertaken to assess the performance of the c ontractor. As long as the criteria set out 
in paragraph 31 above apply, an investment appraisal is  not required.
 
 
Disclosure of Financial Information to Industry  
 
54. It is important that a disclosure strategy is draw n up before the project team 
engages with industry. Project teams planning to  release financial information to industry 
should consult with Partnering Support Group (PSG) and Defence Economics, and provide documented approval from the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for the project. The 
documented disclosure strategy should be referr ed to in the Concept of Analysis and Initial 
Gate Business Case, or equivalents, Additi onal guidance is provided at Annex B.  
 55. The data shared with suppliers on parti cular programmes and projects will vary 
depending on the procurem ent strategy being followed, and individual circumstance. The 
underlying principle is to ensure disclosure is consistent wit h MOD securing the best value 
for money solution to the taxpayer. However, there is a need to protect information whose 
disclosure could harm security or internati onal relations, undermine internal policy or 
prejudice MOD’s position in negotiations with suppliers.  56. Where there is effective competition and adequate funding avai lable, it is not 
usually necessary to release financial inform ation as the competitiv e process will ensure 
value for money is delivered.  
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 35 
57. 
Where there is competition but the affor dability of the requirement is in doubt, an 
indication of the overall funding allocation (a ffordability envelope) and, where relevant, the 
profile of that provision ca n be made. This may prevent nugatory activity from being 
undertaken, and the competitiv e process should ensure the data provided does not 
coincide with MOD’s willingness to pay. 
 58. In a non-competitive env ironment the extent to which MOD may be prepared to 
disclose data must be judged on a case by case basis. Relevant guiding factors will 
include: the position of a project in its life cycle; potential sensitivit ies of international 
partners when the project is a collaborative one; and the nature of the relationship already 
established with specific companies. Exam ples of information that may be disclosed 
include:  
a. An indication of the overall funding al location (affordability envelope) and, where 
relevant, the profile of t hat provision. This should only be considered where the 
affordability of the requirem ent is in doubt, and must not indicate MOD’s willingness 
to pay. 
b. ‘As Is’ or ‘baseline’ costs. This may help MOD and industry to gain a better 
understanding of the existing operation. It will also help to ensure a comprehensive 
and robust profile of the costs of t he current arrangement s is produced; 
c. Details of technical efficiencies. Va lidation with industry will ensure both parties 
have confidence that costs are robus t and the solutions are deliverable. 
d. Known planning assumptions across the life of the project, e.g. known out of service 
dates.   
 59. Examples of information that w ould not normally be released include; 
 
a. Relative price inflation, such as project specific earnings inflation. This is because it 
could become self-fulfilling. 
b. Details of operational (non-technical) efficiencies applied to the VfMB. This would 
undermine the willingness of the Trade Unions to suggest such efficiencies or engage in the process. 
 60. Under no circumstances should the follo wing information be released to industry, 
whether in a competitive or  non-competitive environment: 
 
a. Costed risk adjustments, in to tal, or by constituent parts; 
b. Total VfMB figure inclusive of risk.  
 
Fallback or Exit Strategy 
 61. There is no guarantee that the VfMB or the commercial bids will be affordable. 
Where the VfMB is unaffordable through-life, a modified versi on that is affordable needs to 
be developed, even if the result ing option provides lower capability. The affordable fallback 
option will be used to help demonstrate the re lative benefits of the commercial bids. 
 62. Financial provision should be continually reviewed to  check the affordability 
position of the options being dev eloped, with regard to assump tions on e.g. balance sheet 
treatment, and the ability to flex between RDel and CDel.  63. Solutions that are affordable through- life may have short-term affordability 
shortfalls from one year to the next. Attempts to smooth short-term affordability peaks and 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 36 
troughs with industry must take full cons
ideration of the changes in risk profile this is likely 
to bring. 
 
Tender Evaluation and Value for Money 
 
64. Public contracts must be competed in  accordance with Pu blic Contracts 
Regulations 2006 (PCR) or Defence and Security Publ ic Contracts Regulations 2011 
(DSPCR) (the Regulations).   65. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU) enshrines 
principles of proportionality,  equal treatment, non-discrimi nation and transparency which 
the MOD must apply in relation to its contract award criteria. A pplication of these principles 
also needs to be consistent with the policy requirement to demonstrate value for money. 
 66. This guidance is complementary and s upplementary to that contained within the 
Tendering Suite of Commercia l Policy Statements (see www. aof.dii.r.mil.uk) addressing 
the key issues to ensure that commercial, l egal and economic requirements are coherently 
addressed when establishing the cr iteria for tender evaluation. 
 
Evaluation Strategy 
 
67. The first decision to make is the appropr iate evaluation strategy for the proposal, 
and this is then published in the Contract No tice. In accordance with Regulation 31 of 
DSPCR and Regulation 30 of PCR, the evaluation strategy can be based on either:  
a. Lowest price (lowest cost). The contra ct will be awarded to the ‘lowest price’ 
tender that is technically and commercia lly compliant. This cannot be used if 
the Competitive Dialogue proc edure is being followed. 
 
or 
 
b. Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT). Using an evaluation 
based on MEAT provides the op portunity to take criteria other than price into 
account when awarding a contract. There are several MEAT evaluation strategies that can be adopted. These are set out in the Commercial Policy 
Statement on Tender Management. 
 
Award Criteria 
 
68. Award criteria are the cr iteria the tenders must meet  and those that the tenders 
will be measured against. Where a MEAT evaluatio n strategy is used, appropriate, specific 
and relevant award criteria are scored and weighted to establish which tender is most 
economically advantageous. The criteria should be  sufficiently transparent so that a bidder 
is aware of all the elements to be taken into account by MOD in identifying the most economically advantageous and the relative importance of  those elements. ‘Most 
economically advantageous’ can be taken as bei ng largely analogous to Value for Money 
(VfM), where VfM is defined as the optimal trade-off between time, cost, and effectiveness. 
 69. Award criteria are typica lly grouped into three categor ies: technical, commercial 
and financial. Deciding on the te chnical and commercial criteria  to include is a matter of 
judgement and will vary from project to projec t, but each needs to represent a specific and 
measurable objective. In seeking to establish fundamental end objectives it is useful to: 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 37 
 
a. 
Repeatedly ask the question ‘W hy do you care about that?’; 
b. Ask how the options differ from  one another in ways that matter; 
c. Ask about the overall objectives that are to be achieved. 
 
The award criteria must relate to the goods or services to be provided and not to the suitability of the supplier.  70. Note that choosing award criteria is a separate proc ess to that of selection 
criteria used to assess whether a potential bidder is capable of meeting the requirement. 
Initially, this is done on the basis of economi c/financial standing or te chnical/professional 
ability, but an additional down -select may be exercised by  applying other objective and 
non-discriminatory criteria. Essent ially, it is to determine which potential bidders will be 
invited to participate in di alogue, negotiation, or tender. 
 71. Guidance on the selection, scoring and weighting of award criteria and the 
evaluation methodology is caont ained in Part2, chapter 8. 
 
Publication of criteria 
 
72. The award criteria must be discuss ed with, and endorsed by Defence Economics 
and D Scrutiny or their TLB equivalents in a ddition to commercial and legal staff to ensure 
that the criteria and weightings for tender evaluation are consistent with achieving value for money. The award criteria and their weightings should ideally be endorsed before the 
issue of the Contract Noti ce (OJEU advert) and must be endorsed and incl uded in the 
Tender Documentation before an Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD), Invitation to 
Negotiate (ITN), or Invitati on to Tender (ITT) is issued.  Early engagement with scrutiny 
staff is therefore essential.  
Wider Markets Initiative 
 73. The Wider Markets Initiative (WMI) enc ourages the public sector to adopt a more 
entrepreneurial approach to making the most e ffective and efficient use of public assets, 
by using capacity which is surplus to normal requirements, but which must for wider strategic or other reasons be retained within the public sect or, to generate income. This 
generally involves marketing the assets to pr ivate individuals or companies for revenue, 
which can then be used to fund ac tivities within the public se ctor. Holders of assets can 
run Wider Markets projects themselves; or they may choose to engage a private sector 
partner.  
 74. Policy on wider markets is set out in "Selling into Wider Markets: A Policy Note 
for Public Bodies" HM Treasury 2002  
(http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/ED8AB/New_WM_Guidance.pdf) 
75. When seeking to exploit irreducible  spare capacity under this initiative, 
regulations covering partneri ng and outsourcing apply in the normal way. Consideration 
must be given to the following issues: 
 
a. Treatment of fixed assets; b. Allowance for additional costs to achieve third party income; 
c. Need to appraise WMI against alternatives such as PFI.

Annex A: Demonstrating the Policy - 
Providing Evidence for the Audit Trail 
 The following questions should be considered simultaneously when providing evidence for 
the audit trail.  
1. Circumstances where Defence Strategic Constraints apply to the 
requirement. 
 
Defence Strategic Considerations 
 Why do Defence Strategic Consider ations apply to the requirement? 
 Can these be relaxed?  Are they tradeable? 
 Can a Security of Supply arrangement be used where appropriate? 
 
Market Constraints 
 Is there a competitive market? If yes, use a competit ive procurement approach .  
 Can the market be stimulated through mark et sounding, promoting the requirement 
beyond the market segment from which it is usually procured, aggregating 
requirements or breaking requirements down? If yes, use a competitive 
procurement approach. 
 Can the requirement be reformulated to  enable competitive procurement e.g. 
breaking the requirement down to allow a single source to deliver the protected 
element (subject to the Defence Strategic C onsiderations) whilst other elements are 
procured through competition? If yes, use a competitive procurement and a sole 
source approach for the protected element. 
 Does the MOD have access to IPR to  enable competitive procurement? If yes, use 
a competitive procurement approach and a sole source approach for the 
protected element. 
 Can the IPR be licensed? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach 
through licensing the IPR .  
 Where a non-competitive pr ocurement approach is justif ied, can competition be 
encouraged in the supply network? 
 
2. Circumstances where Defence Strategic Considerations do not apply 
to the requirement 
 Is there a competitive market? If yes, use a competit ive procurement approach .  
 Can the market be stimulated through mark et sounding, promoting the requirement 
beyond the market segment from which it is usually procured, aggregating 
requirements or breaking requirements down? If yes, use a competitive 
procurement approach. 
 Can the requirement be reformulated to  enable competitive procurement e.g. 
breaking the requirement or aggregating r equirements to stimulate industry’s 
interest? If yes, use a competitiv e procurement approach. 
 Does the MOD have access to IPR to  enable competitive procurement? If yes, use 
a competitive procurement approach. 
 Can the IPR be licensed? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach 
through licensing the IPR .  
JSP 507 Pt

 
Can the protected element (subject to IPR restrictions) be procured through a single 
source arrangement whilst other elem ents are procured th rough competition? If 
yes, use a competitive procurement approach and sole source for the 
protected element.    
 Where a non-competitive procurement appr oach is justified,  demonstrate how 
competition be encouraged in the supply network.

Annex B: Disclosure of Financial 
Information to Industry 
 When considering releasing financial information to industry, the key questions that must 
be addressed are:   
a. Why  is it necessary or beneficial to release information? 
b. What  information is it appropriate to release? 
c. When is the appropriate time to release information? 
 The answers to these questions may be different  for each individual project, and Project 
Team Leaders must dec ide what is right for their project.  The aim will always be to 
achieve a better deal for MOD without co mpromising its negotiating position and 
securing best VfM to the taxpayer.  
 The Project Team Leader is accountable for the scale of the cost information released, and is required to demonstrate t hat its release is appropriate  in order to optimise the 
potential for a value for money outcome.  A record of the rational e applied must be 
incorporated into the Disclosure Strategy documentation, and addre ssed as part of the 
evaluation process for the project. 
 
Key factors to be considered 
 
The release of financial information should only o ccur after the consideration of all relevant 
factors by the Project Team.  The following provides a summary of the key factors: 
 The assessment of the relative strength and practicability of effective competition. 
 Is it necessary to release cost information or will the underlying assumptions be 
sufficient?  
 A judgement on the potential ad ded value likely to be gained by the project in terms of 
cost, time and performance 
 What other non-financial information is being di sclosed?  Is it compatible with the cost 
disclosure information? 
 What outcome is required as a result of disclosure? 
 Is disclosure likely to weaken MOD’s negotiating position? 
 
Benefits 
 
There are benefits from disclosur e of information to industry in certain circumstances: 
 A full understanding on how business is currently conducted. 
 An awareness of the Author ity’s future requirements. 
 Identification of the key cost drivers and where efficiency gains may be possible. 
 Validation of technical effici encies that could be incorpor ated into the VfMB in order 
that all parties have confidence the costs are robust and the solutions are 
deliverable. 
 An opportunity to understand t he business processes, in pa rticular, where transfer 
of risk benefits and business re-engin eering can be made to best effect. 
 Improve understanding of the capability deliverable from  the funding available. 
JSP 507 Pt
.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 42 
JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14) 43 Provides an indicative ta rget for industry to aim at. 
 The identification and understanding of risk. 
 Prevents nugatory activity when affordability is severely constrained. 
 
Risks 
 
The risks associated with disclosure of  information to industry include: 
 Bidders may be inclined to bid just below the indicative target figure provided.  This 
can be mitigated by emphasising that meeting the target is unlikely to be sufficient 
to secure the deal.  Value for money do es not necessarily mean selecting the 
cheapest option.   
 Loss of negotiating lever age.  This should not be affected if negotiations are 
pursued following extant commercial guidance. 
 The unnecessary transfer of intellectual capital.
